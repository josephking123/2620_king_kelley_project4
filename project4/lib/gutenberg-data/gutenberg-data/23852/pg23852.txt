PREFACE.


The principal object of this little work is the dissemination of
information in regard to the Canadian Postal Service. It is published
with the kind permission of the Postmaster General, and it is hoped will
be useful to the public as well as conducive to the interests of the
Post Office.

The short and imperfect sketch of the progress of the post office in
Canada, which has been compiled from authentic sources, will be found
interesting. It extends over a period of one hundred years, and serves
to mark a rapidity of improvement which, in a country purely
agricultural, has seldom been surpassed.

As the regulations of the post office are subject to constant change, it
is proposed to issue new editions of the Canadian Postal Guide, revised
and corrected to the latest date, half-yearly, or yearly, as
circumstances may appear to require.

Toronto, January, 1863.

A FEW FACTS ABOUT THE POST OFFICE IN CANADA.

COMPILED FROM AUTHENTIC SOURCES.


The earliest records of the administration of the post office in Canada
bear date 1750, at which period the celebrated Benjamin Franklin was
Deputy Postmaster General of North America. At the time of his
appointment the revenue of the department was insufficient to defray his
salary of £300 per annum; but under his judicious management not only
was the postal accommodation in the Provinces considerably extended, but
the revenue so greatly increased, that ere long the profit for one year,
which he remitted to the British treasury, amounted to £3000.

In the evidence given by Franklin before the British House of Commons in
the year 1766, in regard to the extent of the post office accommodation
in North America, he made the following statement:--

"The posts generally travel along the sea coasts, and only in a few
cases do they go back into the country. Between Quebec and Montreal
there is only one post per month. The inhabitants live so scattered and
remote from each other in that vast country that the posts cannot be
supported amongst them. The English colonies, too, along the frontier
are very thinly settled."

Franklin was removed in 1774. War broke out a few months afterwards
between the North American Provinces and the Mother Country; and the
charge of the post office in Canada was assumed by Mr. Hugh Finlay, who,
it appears, had under Franklin performed the duties of postmaster at
Quebec.

Mr. Finlay is designated in his commission as Deputy Postmaster General
of His Majesty's "Province of Canada," from which it would seem that the
Lower Provinces were not included in his charge.

An Almanac published in Quebec in the year 1791 thus describes the
condition of the Department:--

  Hugh Finlay, Esq., Deputy Postmaster General  Quebec,            L. C.
  Wm. E. Edwards, Postmaster                    Montreal,            "
  Samuel Sills,       "                         Three Rivers,        "
  Louis Aime,         "                         Berthier,            "
  Hugh Munroe,        "                         Bai edes Chaleurs,   "
  Samuel Anderson,    "                         Cornwall,          U. C.
  John Munroe,        "                         Matilda,             "
  John Jones,         "                         Augusta,             "
  Peter Clarke,       "                         Kingston,            "
  Joseph Edwards,     "                         Niagara,             "
  George Leitch,      "                         Detroit,             "
  ---- Mitchell       "                         Mickelmackinac,      "


There were thus five post offices in Lower Canada, and seven post
offices in Upper Canada.

Between Quebec and England mails were despatched once per month; between
Quebec and Halifax, twice per week in summer, and once per week in
winter; between Quebec and Montreal, twice per week; and between
Montreal and the offices above Montreal, once per month; between Quebec
and Baie des Chaleurs mails were despatched "as occasion offered."

In the year 1792, 1793, and 1794, the mail was carried once per month
between Montreal and Kingston by a French Canadian named Morisette;
between Kingston and York it was carried by Alex. Anderson; and between
York and Niagara by a Mohawk Indian. The rate of travel was probably
about 20 miles per day; the route being either by a path through the
woods or along the shores of the River St. Lawrence and Lake Ontario: no
regular road having been at that time in existence.

In the summer season the mail was carried between Kingston and Niagara
by the Government vessels,--

       Caldwell,
       Mohawk,
       Oneida, and
       Speedy.

Between Canandaigua, in the State of New York, and Niagara, the mail was
carried once per week at a cost of $200 per annum.

In the year 1796 there were precisely the same number of offices, and
generally the same amount of mail accommodation, as in in 1791.

Mr. Finlay was succeeded in the year 1800 by Mr. George Heriot. In 1803
Upper Canada had 8 post offices, but the mails were not more frequent
than in 1791. In 1804 there were in Lower Canada 5 post offices; in
Upper Canada, 9; in Nova Scotia, 6; in Cape Breton, 1; in Prince
Edward's Island, 1; in New Brunswick, 4.

The late Mr. Wood, who filled the office of postmaster of Cornwall for
many years, thus describes the condition of the department in the Upper
Canada Province about the year 1807:--

      "When I first took charge of the post office in this place the
      mail was carried from Quebec to Amherstburg on the back of an
      old Canadian pedestrian; he performed his trip once in three
      months, and his arrival was hailed with joy by the then
      contented and loyal inhabitants throughout the country."

The following is a copy of a somewhat curious advertisement which appears in
the <i>Upper Canada Gazette</i>, published in the year 1807:--

      "The mail for Upper Canada will be despatched from the post
      office at Montreal, on the following days, to wit:

         "Monday, 14th January.
         "Monday, 12th February.
         "Monday, 10th March.
         "Monday, 7th April--the last trip.

      "A courier from Kingston may be looked for here in 14 or 15
      days from the above periods, where he will remain 2 or 3 days,
      and then return to Kingston.

      "Another courier will proceed from this with the Niagara mail,
      <i>viâ</i> Messrs. Hatts, where the Sandwich letters will be left,
      both from Niagara and this 'till the courier comes from there
      to return with them.

      "Letters put into the post office will be forwarded at any
      time by

      "W. ALLAN,
      "Acting Deputy Postmaster."

There are in existence several commissions issued by Mr. Heriot to
postmasters in Nova Scotia, in which he signs himself Deputy Postmaster
General for the Province of Upper and Lower Canada, Nova Scotia, and New
Brunswick, and their dependencies. It would appear therefore, at all
events, that during a portion of his term of office he had supervision
of all the posts in those colonies.

Mr. Heriot was succeeded in the year 1816 by Mr. Daniel Sutherland, who,
on his accession to office, found Nova Scotia and Prince Edward's Island
wholly withdrawn from the Canada charge. New Brunswick, however,
continued to be included in it. The postmasters in that Province being
commissioned at Quebec and accounting to the Deputy Postmaster General
there.

In the year 1817 Lower Canada had 13 post offices; Upper Canada, 12;
Nova Scotia, 6; New Brunswick, 3; Prince Edward's Island, 1. In this
year the mails were running between Quebec and Halifax once a fortnight,
all the year round; between Quebec and Kingston, once a week; between
Kingston and Toronto, once a week; and between Toronto and Amherstburg,
once a fortnight.

In the year 1820 there were in Lower Canada 20 post offices; in Upper
Canada, 19; in Nova Scotia, 6; in New Brunswick, 3; in Prince Edward's
Island, 1.

In 1824 there were in Upper and Lower Canada 69 post offices, and 1992
miles of established mail routes. The annual travel of the mail was
370,000 miles. The gross revenue was $68,000; and the revenue
transmitted to England, after deducting $1200, the supposed surplus for
New Brunswick, $21,000. At this time the population of Lower Canada was
about 440,000, and of Upper Canada 150,000.

In this year Mr. Sutherland was succeeded, as Deputy Postmaster General,
by Mr. Thos. A. Stayner, and shortly after was effected the separation
of nearly the whole of New Brunswick from the Canada charge.

Under the long and able administration of Mr. Stayner, extending from
the year 1824 to 1851, postal accommodation was greatly extended
throughout Upper and Lower Canada.

In 1827 there were 101 post offices and 2368 miles of established post
route. The annual transportation of the mail was 455,000 miles. The
estimated number of letters passing through the post in the year was
340,000; the estimated number of papers, 400,000.

In the year 1832 the Duke of Richmond, then Postmaster General, proposed
a re-modification of the post office throughout British North America.
An Act was prepared with this object, but the attempt to pass it through
the several Legislatures failed, and of all the plans that had been
contemplated only two were carried into effect, namely, the
establishment of an Accountant's Office and the appointment of Local
Inspectors.

The attention of the Legislature of Upper Canada was, about this time,
frequently turned to the post office, which still continued under the
Imperial control. Committees were appointed and reports made, in which
the transfer of the management of the department to the Colonial
Government was strongly urged.

In the year 1837 a joint address from the Legislative Council and
Assembly was adopted, praying that the revenue produced by the post
office in the Colonies should no longer be remitted to England. This
address was referred to the Lords of the Treasury, and by them referred
to Lord Durham, on the ground that some general measure was required to
carry its prayer into effect. Nothing, however, was done until some
years afterwards towards the accomplishment of this end.

A large and steady increase continued to take place yearly in the
business and revenue of the post office. In 1838 there were 380 post
offices, and 5486 miles of established post route. The annual
transportation of the mail was 1,345,000 miles; the estimated number of
letters carried, 1,000,000; the estimated number of newspapers,
1,250,000; and the gross revenue, $146,000.

The following extract from the Quebec <i>Mercury</i>, published on the 18th
July, 1829, conveys some idea of the postal communication with England
at that period:--

      "No later advices have been received from Europe since our
      last. Some further extracts from the London papers, to 31st
      May inclusive, brought to New York by the 'Corinthian,' will
      be found in another part of this number."

The following extract from the Montreal <i>Courant</i>, of September 2, 1829,
describes the improvement which had at that date been effected in the
postal communication between that city and Prescott:--

      "Expeditious Travelling.--On Saturday last the Upper Canada
      line of stages performed the journey from Prescott to this
      city in about 17 hours, leaving the former place at a little
      before 3 A.M., and arriving here a few minutes before 8 in the
      evening. Not many years ago this journey occupied two and
      sometimes three days, but owing to the great improvements made
      by Mr. Dickinson, the enterprising proprietor, by putting
      steam boats on the Lakes St. Francis and St. Louis, and
      keeping his horses in excellent condition, it is now performed
      in little more than one-third of the time."

The following advertisement, which appeared in the year 1833 in the
<i>Colonial Advocate</i>, published at Queenston by the late Mr. W. L.
Mackenzie, will give some idea of the postal facilities in the Upper
Province at that period:--

      "POST RIDER WANTED IMMEDIATELY.

      "The proprietor of this newspaper wishes to contract with a
      steady man (who can find and uphold his own horse), to deliver
      it to the subscribers once a week during the winter, on the
      route between York and Niagara <i>viâ</i> Ancaster."

Regular steam communication was established across the Atlantic in the
year 1841, and about that time the rate of postage on letters between
any part of Canada and any part of the United Kingdom was, on the
recommendation of Mr. Stayner, reduced to a uniform charge of 1s. 2d.
sterling, per half ounce. Thus, it is believed, was first recognized the
principle of a uniform rate of postage--irrespective of distance--which
has since been so universally adopted.

In 1848 there were 539 post offices and 6895 miles of post route; the
annual transportation of the mail was 2,225,000 miles; the estimated
number of letters carried in a year 2,000,000; and the gross revenue
$260,000.

On the 6th April, 1851, was effected the transfer of the post office in
Canada from the control of the Imperial authorities, to the Colonial
Government. Mr. Stayner retired from office, and the Hon. James Morris,
the first Canadian Postmaster General, assumed charge of the department.

In 1851 postage, which had previously been charged according to the
distance the letter was carried, which it was computed averaged 15 cents
on each letter, was reduced to a uniform charge of 5 cents per 1/2 oz.,
the decrease being equivalent to 2/3 or 66-2/3 per cent. on the former
rate. A very considerable reduction was also effected in the rate of
postage on newspapers. The increase in the number of letters transmitted
through the post, within a year after the reduction of the rate, was 75
per cent. Several improvements, including the introduction of postage
stamps, were effected in this year, and the operations of the department
greatly extended.

On the 31st March, 1853, the Hon. James Morris was succeeded as
Postmaster General by the Hon. Malcolm Cameron. At the latter end of
this year and the beginning of the year following the conveyance of the
mails was transferred to the Northern Railway between Toronto and
Bradford, and to the Great Western Railway between Suspension Bridge and
Windsor. The Hon. Malcolm Cameron was succeeded by the Hon. Robert
Spence, who assumed charge of the department on the 11th September,
1854. In February, 1855, the money order system was first introduced
into Canada. The system was at first confined to 84 post offices: it now
embraces within its operations 229 offices. The month of May, 1856, was
marked by the first voyage to the St. Lawrence of the line of Canadian
Steamers, under contract with Hugh Allan, Esq., of Montreal, for the
conveyance of the mails between Quebec and Liverpool in summer, and
Portland and Liverpool in winter. In October, 1856, the Grand Trunk
Railway, which had previously been completed as far westward as
Brockville, was opened from the latter point to Toronto, and, in
connection with the Great Western Railway, an unbroken line of postal
communication established between Quebec in the east, and Windsor in the
west. The following statement of the time occupied in the transit of a
letter in winter between Quebec and the principal cities and towns in
Western Canada, in 1853 and in 1857, will give some idea of the
improvement effected:--

                          In 1853.      In 1857.

     "      Ottawa       3      "       24   "

In August, 1857, the exemption of postage on newspapers was confined to
newspapers transmitted from the office of publication to regular
subscribers--all other newspapers being made liable to charge. On the
1st February, 1858, Mr. Spence retired from office, and was succeeded as
Postmaster General by the Hon. Sidney Smith. In May, 1857, the Canadian
Ocean Steamers, under contract with Mr. Hugh Allan, commenced a weekly
service between Quebec and Liverpool in summer, and Portland and
Liverpool in winter. These steamers, and the Grand Trunk Railway,
between Portland and Quebec on the east, and Detroit on the west, which
was completed a few month afterwards, have made Canada one of the great
postal as well as commercial highways between Europe and the Western
States. Closed mails are now carried under treaties with the several
governments with regularity and despatch.

In July, 1859, postage was re-imposed on newspapers sent from the office
of publication to regular subscribers. Postage rates were computed in
dollars and cents; and letters addressed to any place in Canada, if
posted unpaid, were subjected to an additional rate of two cents per
half ounce. A large augmentation continued to take place in every
department of the post office; the mails carried by the Ocean Steamers,
especially, rapidly increased. The four mails of January, 1862, carried
30,000 letters from Canada, and brought 31,000 letters to the
Province--a number far beyond the previous average of a mid-winter
month. In May, 1862, Mr. Smith resigned his office, and was succeeded by
the Hon. M. H. Foley, who now presides over the department.

The following statement will convey some idea of the rapid growth of the
postal system in this Province, since the transfer to the control of the
Colonial Government, in 1851:--

Kingdom for Canada, unless specially addressed "By Canadian Steamer" or
"By Cunard Steamer," are despatched in the first mail that is made
up--whether for the Canadian or Cunard line--after the letter is posted,
so that letters intended for the Canadian Packets must either be posted
on the proper days for the Canadian Packet Mails or bear the words "By
Canadian Mail Steamer" on the address.

Twopence sterling, equal to 5 cents, will be charged on the delivery of
letters which have been forwarded as above by Cunard Steamers, but on

[Sidenote: If commuted rate not prepaid.]

When the above rates are not paid in advance by either the publisher or
subscriber the papers are charged 1 cent each on delivery.


[Sidenote: Payment of commuted rate.]

It is not necessary that the commuted rate on newspapers should be paid
absolutely on the first day of each quarter. The regulation is intended
to be carried out with all possible consideration for the convenience of
the public, and it will be sufficient if the person desiring to pay the
commuted rate declares his intention and offers the payment when first
calling at the office within a reasonable time after the commencement of
the quarter; but after having made his option to pre-pay the commuted
charge, or to pay for his papers as received at one cent each, as the
case may be, postmasters are not expected to alter their newspaper
accounts to allow of a change until the commencement of the next
quarter.

The commuted rate of payment can be accepted from new subscribers during
a quarter for any unexpired period of the quarter not less than a month.

oz. or fraction of 8oz., which must be pre-paid.


[Sidenote: Rate to United States.]

Transient newspapers addressed to the United States must be pre-paid one
cent each by postage stamp, otherwise they will not be forwarded.


[Sidenote: From United States.]

Newspapers posted in the United States and addressed to Canada are
liable to one cent each on delivery. The stamp <i>paid</i> on these papers
indicates that the United States postage only has been pre-paid, the
Canadian rate of one cent remaining to be collected.


[Sidenote: American papers.]

American newspapers posted or re-posted in Canada must be prepaid one
cent each, by stamp, otherwise they will not be forwarded.


[Sidenote: Commuted rate not applicable to U.S. papers.]

papers published in the United States: they must be paid for at the full
rate of one cent each.

booksellers or agents pass free in the same way as if received by the
Canadian Steamers.


[Sidenote: Commuted rate on newspapers to places out of Canada.]

Canadian newspapers addressed from the office of publication to
subscribers in the United States, the United Kingdom, Lower Provinces,
&c., may be forwarded on pre-payment of the commuted rate, applicable to
subscribers within the Province; but they cannot be forwarded if unpaid.

publishers in Canada and publishers in the United States, are carried
<i>free</i> through the post.

publishers should send them to the post office put up in a manner to
admit of their being readily counted, and if necessary withdrawn from
their covers for examination. The newspapers for each office also should
be made up in strong paper in a separate parcel, which should be plainly
addressed.


[Sidenote: Notification to publishers of non-delivery.]

When the numbers of a newspaper published in Canada or in either of the
other British North American Provinces, or in the United States, and
issued daily, have remained in a post office in Canada uncalled for
during two weeks; of a newspaper issued semi-weekly, or tri-weekly,
during three weeks; of a newspaper issued weekly, during one month; and
of a monthly periodical during two months, or when such newspapers and
periodicals have been refused to be taken by the party to whom
addressed, the postmaster is instructed to notify the respective
publishers in the proper form, which is to pass free of postage. If the
newspaper or periodical continues to arrive after the notice has been
sent, the postmaster is instructed to notify the publisher in the same
way a second time, specially calling his attention to the first notice
given.


[Sidenote: Enclosures in newspapers.]

serve the purposes of a letter, or to enclose any other thing (except
publishers' accounts and receipts, as before mentioned) in a newspaper

PERIODICAL PUBLICATIONS.


[Sidenote: Definition.]

Periodical Publications are publications issued at regular intervals,
but less frequently than once per week.


[Sidenote: Rate to Canada and U. States.]

Periodical Publications can be transmitted by post to any part of
Canada and the United States at the following rates:--

  For every periodical publication weighing not more
  than 3 oz. in weight .................................. 1 cent.
  Over 3oz. in weight  .................................. 4 cents.                                                        4 cents.


[Sidenote: Pre-pay'mt]

The above rates must invariably be pre-paid by postage stamps.


[Sidenote: Sent from publication office.]

If pre-paid by postage stamps and sent from the office of publication,
periodicals published in Canada weighing over 3 oz. pass for two cents
each.


[Sidenote: From United States.]

Periodical publications received from the United States are liable to
the rates above mentioned, viz.: If not exceeding 3 oz. 1 cent; if
exceeding 3 oz. 4 cents.


[Sidenote: If posted by booksellers or news agents.]

Canadian Booksellers and News Agents may post British, American or
Provincial periodicals for distribution to regular subscribers unpaid.
If sent unpaid they will, when exceeding the weight of 3 oz., be subject
to 4 cents.


[Sidenote: Small periodicals posted by booksellers and news agents.]

Canadian Booksellers and News Agents may also post for transmission by

States, weighing less than 1 oz., such as the Children's Paper, Child's
Paper, The Play Hour, The Carrier Dove, The Sabbath School Visitor, The
Evangelizer, The Gospel Message, The Good News, and others of a like
description, in packages to one address, at the rate of 5 cents per
pound, or fraction of a pound bulk weight, provided that the said News
Agents and Booksellers pre-pay such packages by postage stamps. This
must not be understood as imposing a charge on Canadian periodicals
entitled to pass free.


[Sidenote: Periodicals exempt from postage.]

Periodicals printed in Canada other than newspapers when specially
devoted to education, meaning the instruction of youth, (both religious
and general), to agriculture, to temperance, or to any branch of
science, and addressed directly from the office of publication to be
transmitted to any post-office in Canada, are conveyed by mail free of
charge. Such periodicals must not contain general news or advertisements
or they forfeit their claim to exemption.

A periodical devoted to education to pass free must be either strictly
scholastic in its subject matter, or manifestly adapted and intended for
juvenile as distinguished from adult instruction. It is in this primary
sense that the word Education, whether religious or secular, is
understood to be used. Religious publications are not as a class
entitled to exemption from charge. The law exempts only those which come
within the foregoing definitions.

No United States periodical of any kind or description can, upon any
ground, claim exemption from Canadian postage.

the address, they are liable to full letter rates of postage.

Countries, <i>viâ</i> England, or for the United States, both the postage and
the registration fee must be pre-paid.


[Sidenote: Books, &c., cannot be registered.]

Books, periodicals, newspapers, circulars, and other printed matter,
cannot be registered unless pre-paid the full letter rates, in addition
to the ordinary registration fee.


[Sidenote: Receipt required on Delivery.]

Registered letters and packets can only be delivered to the parties to
whom they are addressed or to their order, and a receipt must be given
on the delivery of each registered letter in a book kept by every
Postmaster for that purpose.


[Sidenote: Post office not responsible for loss.]

It should be clearly understood that the post office is not responsible
for the safe delivery of a registered letter or parcel. The registration
simply makes its transmission more secure, by rendering it practicable
to trace it, when passing from one place to another in Canada, from its
receipt to its delivery; and when addressed from any place in Canada to
any place in the United States, the United Kingdom, or parts abroad, if
not to its delivery, at least to the frontier or port of despatch.

POSTAGE STAMPS.


[Sidenote: Prices of stamps.]

Every postmaster is required to have on hand a sufficient stock of
postage stamps, and to sell them to the public at 1 cent, 5 cents, 10
cents, 12-1/2 cents, and 17 cents each.


[Sidenote: Envelopes.]

Letter envelopes are also provided with medallion, stamps equivalent to
5 cents and 10 cents postage, each. The 5 cent envelopes are sold
singly at 6 cents each; 66 cents per dozen; $5.50 per hundred. The 10
cent envelopes are sold singly at 11 cents each; $1.26 per dozen; $10.50
per hundred.


[Sidenote: Sale to dealers.]

With the approval of the Postmaster General, postage stamps are sold to
certain dealers to retail again to the public.


[Sidenote: Pre-payment in stamps.]

Pre-payment of letters should, in all cases where practicable, be made
by postage stamps.


[Sidenote: Mutilated stamps.]

A mutilated stamp, or a stamp cut in half, is not recognized in
pre-payment of postage.


[Sidenote: Medallion stamps.]

A medallion stamp cannot be accepted in pre-payment of postage if
separated from the envelope of which it may have formed a part.


[Sidenote: British and foreign.]

No British stamps, or stamps of a foreign country, can be received in
pre-payment of postage in Canada.


[Sidenote: Mode of affixing.]

In affixing the stamp to the letter wet slightly the corner of the
envelope and the gummed side of the stamp, and gently press the stamp
till it is firmly fixed. Stamps should be placed on the front or address
side of the letter, and on the right hand upper corner.


[Sidenote: Partial payment in.]

Letters cannot be pre-paid partly in stamps and partly in money; the
pay-postage must be pre-paid either wholly in stamps, or wholly in
money.


[Sidenote: Insufficient pre-payment.]

If the stamps affixed to a letter addressed to any place in British
North America be not adequate to the proper postage, the letter is rated
with an amount equal to the deficiency.


[Sidenote: Do. United States.]

Letters addressed to the United States, on which stamps are affixed
representing less than the amount of postage to which the letters are
liable, are rated with full unpaid postage.


[Sidenote: Stamps received for postage.]

Postage stamps are received at all post offices in payment of postage on
unpaid letters delivered therefrom.


<tb>


MONEY ORDERS.


[Sidenote: Money order offices.]

Post offices in Canada at which money orders are issued and paid are
distinguished in the List of Post Offices by being printed in <i>italics</i>.


[Sidenote: Orders issued.]

Every money order office in Canada issues money orders on every other
money order office in Canada, as well as on every money order office in
the United Kingdom. Every money order office in the United Kingdom also
issues money orders on every money order office in Canada.


[Sidenote: Commission on Canadian orders.]

The rate of commission charged on money orders drawn by one money order
office in Canada on any other money order office in Canada, is as
follows:--

  If not exceeding in amount $10           5 cents.
  Exceeding $10 and not exceeding $20     10   "
      "      20    "        "      30     15   "
      "      30    "        "      40     30   "
      "      40    "        "      60     45   "
      "      60    "        "      80     60   "
      "      80    "        "     100     75   "


[Sidenote: Half cents.]

No half cents can be introduced into orders.


[Sidenote: Amount of single orders not to exceed $100.]

No money order exceeding $100 in amount can be granted on any office in
Canada; but postmasters are at liberty to grant two or more orders for
$100 or for any lesser sum. They cannot, however, grant two or more
orders for sums of or under $30 on the same day to the same applicant in
favor of the same payee.


[Sidenote: Orders on United Kingdom.]

Money orders on the United Kingdom are drawn in sterling money, and may
be for any sum from one shilling to ten pounds. They must not, however,
exceed the latter amount; but postmasters are at liberty to issue two or
more separate orders for ten pounds each or for any smaller sum.


[Sidenote: Commission on do.]

The rate of commission charged on orders on the United Kingdom, over and
above the currency value of the sterling, is as follows:--

  For orders not exceeding £2 sterling           25 cents.
  Exceeding £2 and not exceeding £5 sterling     50   "
      "      5    "        "      7    "         75   "
      "      7    "        "     10    "         $1.

Tables shewing the amount of Provincial currency required for money
orders issued in Canada upon the United Kingdom, in addition to the
commission, and paid for money orders issued in the United Kingdom on
Canada, will be found at pages 41, 42, and 43.


[Sidenote: Printed applications.]

Applicants for money orders should always use the printed application
forms, in which they should fill up the particulars of the order
required. These forms are supplied gratuitously at all money order
offices.


[Sidenote: Full names and residences required.]

The christian and surnames in full, and residences, both of the remitter
and the payee, should be furnished to the issuing postmaster. When a
married woman is either the remitter or payee, her own christian name
should be given, and not that of her husband, thus--"Mrs. Mary Smith,"
not "Mrs. John Smith."

If the remitter or payee be a Peer or a Bishop, his ordinary title is
sufficient. If a firm, the usual designation of such firm will suffice,
such as "Baring Bros.," "Smith & Son," "Jones & Co."


[Sidenote: Orders should be examined.]

Parties procuring money orders should examine them carefully to see that
they are properly filled up and stamped. This caution will appear the
more necessary when it is understood that any important defect in these
respects will throw difficulties in the way of payment.


[Sidenote: Erroneous orders.]

Money orders which, in consequence of misapprehension of the name of the
remitter or place of payment have been erroneously made out, can be
returned to the postmaster, and a correct order given in exchange; a new
commission, however, will be charged on the corrected order.


[Sidenote: Repayment of orders at issuing office.]

Parties obtaining money orders on Canadian offices can procure repayment
thereof on presentation of the orders at the office at which issued,
signing the receipt at the foot. No order, however, can be repaid
without the authority of the superintendent, unless presented for
repayment on the day on which it is issued. Neither can orders on the
United Kingdom be repaid without his special authority.


[Sidenote: Orders on United Kingdom can be paid through a bank.]

When a remitter desires an order on the United Kingdom to be paid
through a bank, it is left to his option to give or withhold the name of
the payee, or to substitute for the name of the payee any other
designation or modification, such as "the Cashier of the Bank of
England," "the Chief Clerk of the Foreign Office." Such orders must,
however, be crossed by the issuing postmaster with the name of bank
through which the order is to be paid.


[Sidenote: No credit allowed.]

The issue of money orders on credit, or for cheques not marked "good" by
the bank drawn upon, is strictly prohibited.

If a payee is unable to write, he must sign the receipt at the foot of
the order, in the presence of the paying postmaster, by making his mark,
to be witnessed in writing; as, for example:--
                                                  His
  <i>Witness,--John Kenny,</i>       <i>Joseph</i> X <i>Allen</i>.
  <i>Queen Street, Toronto</i>.                   Mark.


[Sidenote: Order of payee in favor of second person.]

In cases of money orders issued in Canada, postmasters are at liberty to
accept the written order of the payee on the order itself in favour of a
second person, if through illness or insuperable difficulty the payee is
prevented from presenting the order in person.


[Sidenote: Lost orders.]

When a Canadian money order has been lost, either by the remitter or
payee, the circumstance must be made known to the superintendent, who,
under certain precautions, will issue a duplicate.


[Sidenote: Duplicates of British orders.]

Duplicates of sterling orders can only be granted by the paying country.
Thus the British post office issues duplicates of orders drawn in Canada
on the United Kingdom, and the Canadian Head Money Order Office grants
duplicates of orders drawn in the United Kingdom on Canada.


[Sidenote: Lapsed orders.]

Money orders which are not presented until one full year after their
date are considered as lapsed orders, and cannot be paid without the
special permission of the superintendent. In all such cases satisfactory
reasons should be given explanatory of the delay in the presentation of
the order.


[Sidenote: Orders on Canada issued in Malta and Gibraltar.]

The Deputy Postmasters General of Malta and Gibraltar are authorized to
issue money orders on the several money order offices in Canada. Money
order offices in Canada do not, however, grant money orders on Malta and
Gibraltar.


<tb>


GENERAL REGULATIONS.


[Sidenote: Exemption from juries, inquests, and militia.]

Postmasters and certain other officers of the department are exempt from
serving on juries or inquests, or in the militia. This exemption applies
to mail carriers, but not to assistants appointed and paid by
postmasters.


[Sidenote: Officers prohibited from voting.]

The postmasters of Quebec, Montreal, Three Rivers, and Sherbrooke, and
the postmasters of incorporated cities and towns in Upper Canada,
divided into wards, and other officers of the Post Office Department,
excepting Postmasters at other than the above places, cannot legally
vote at the election of any member of the Legislative Council or of the
Legislative Assembly.


[Sidenote: No credit allowed.]

Postmasters are not authorized to give credit for postage, if they do so
it is entirely at their own risk.


[Sidenote: Return of letter to sender not allowed.]

A letter once posted becomes the property of the person to whom it is
addressed, and must be forwarded according to its direction. On no
application, however urgent, can it be delivered back to the writer, or
to any other person.


[Sidenote: Letters addressed to firms, &c.]

A letter addressed to a firm may be delivered to any member of the firm.
If addressed to several persons it may be delivered to any one of them.


[Sidenote: Letters delivered to wrong parties.]

A letter delivered to the wrong person in consequence of his name being
the same as the one of the person for whom the letter is really
intended, should be at once returned to the postmaster from whom
received, the party writing on the cover "opened by me through mistake,"
and signing his name thereto.


[Sidenote: Letters posted without proper direction or prepayment.]

Letters posted without any direction, or addressed so imperfectly that
they cannot be forwarded to their intended destinations, and also unpaid
or insufficiently paid letters addressed to countries to which letters
cannot be sent without the postage is pre-paid, are returned to the
writers through the Dead Letter Office.


[Sidenote: Information not to be given.]

No information can be given respecting letters which pass through a post
office except to the persons to whom they are addressed.


[Sidenote: Redirection of letters.]

Parties desiring their letters and papers to be re-directed should send
an intimation to that effect in writing to the postmaster of the office
from which the letters and papers are to be re-directed.

Postmasters are allowed to re-direct letters to the known places of
residence of the parties to whom they are addressed, after allowing a
reasonable time to elapse without their being called for.


[Sidenote: No extra charge.]

Letters and papers are not subject to any additional charge when
re-directed from one post office in Canada to another post office in
Canada.


[Sidenote: Objectionable matter.]

Postmasters are instructed not to receive any letter or packet which
there is good reason to believe contains glass or anything likely to
injure the contents of the mail bag or the person of any officer of the
post office.


[Sidenote: Change.]

A postmaster is not legally bound to furnish change, but if absolutely
necessary may require that the exact amount of postage on any letter or
packet be tendered to him in current coin, or in Canada postage stamps.


[Sidenote: Civility required from Postmasters.]

Postmasters and their assistants in the above matter, as well as in all
their official intercourse with the public, are expected to afford every
accommodation, and to treat every person having business at their
offices with every courtesy.


[Sidenote: Mail couriers to receive letters <i>en route</i>.]

Mail couriers are bound to receive letters offered to them whilst on the
road between one post office and another, provided that when a letter is
so offered the distance from the nearest post office exceeds one mile.
Such letters are termed Way Letters, and are subject to the ordinary
rates of postage.


<tb>


SUGGESTIONS TO THE PUBLIC.

Facility will be given to the Post Office in the discharge of its daily
duties, and greater security afforded to the Public, by careful
attention to the following recommendations:


[Sidenote: Early posting.]

Post all letters and newspapers, &c., as early as practicable,
especially when sent in large numbers.


[Sidenote: Newspaper.]

When a number of newspapers are addressed to the same office, put them
up in one parcel.


[Sidenote: Circulars.]

When a number of circulars are posted, tie them up in a bundle, with the
addresses all in one direction.


[Sidenote: Address.]

Address letters, papers, &c., in a legible and complete manner, always
giving the name of the Post Office; and if there be more than one Post
Office of that name, the name of the county in which situated: In case
of letters going abroad, the name of the country, as well as of the town
and city, should be given in full. Letters, for example, intended for
London, England, if simply addressed "London," would be forwarded to
London, Canada West, and thus be delayed.


[Sidenote: Secure folding.]

See that every letter, newspaper, or other packet sent by post, is
securely folded and sealed. Every such packet has to be several times
handled; and even when in the mail bag, is exposed to pressure and
friction. Unless, therefore, the article be light and pliant, it should
be enclosed in strong paper, linen, parchment, or some other material
which will not readily tear or break.


[Sidenote: Newspaper covers.]

Fasten the covers of newspapers firmly, so as to prevent them from
slipping out.


[Sidenote: Letter Box.]

When dropping a letter or newspaper into a letter-box, always see that
the packet falls into the box, and does not stick in its passage.


[Sidenote: Letters for hot climates.]

Never seal letters for the East and West Indies and other hot climates,
with wax. Such a practice is attended with much inconvenience, and
frequently with serious injury, in consequence of the melting of the
wax, and the adhesion of the letters to each other. In all such cases
use either wafers or gum, and advise your correspondents in the country
referred to to do the same.


[Sidenote: Letters containing money or value.]

Never send money or other articles of value through the Post Office,
except either by means of a money-order or in a registered letter.
Carefully secure every letter or packet containing money or value, first
with gum and afterwards with good sealing-wax, on which make the clear
impression of a seal.


[Sidenote: Registered letters.]

On posting a registered letter or packet, always obtain a receipt for
the same at the office where posted.


[Sidenote: Delayed and missing letters and papers.]

When letters or papers are delayed or missing, at once communicate the
fact to the Inspector of the division in which is situated the Post
Office at which the delayed or missing letters were posted. In case of a
missing letter enclosing value, state the exact contents, the exact
address, and the office at which posted; the name of the person by whom
posted, and the name of the person by whom received at the office. In
the case of a delayed letter or paper, send the cover or wrapper in an
entire state, in order that the place of delay may be ascertained by an
examination of the post marks.


[Sidenote: Strict enquiry in cases of loss.]

Trouble and loss occasionally arise out of the carelessness or
dishonesty of parties employed in the Post Office service; yet instances
are not wanting in which it has been shown to the satisfaction even of
the complainants, that the fault at first attributed to the Post Office,
in truth rested in other quarters. Thefts by private hands, although
very difficult of proof, have not unfrequently been brought to light;
and it is greatly to be desired that those who suffer loss should, in
the first instance, and while the circumstances are fresh, endeavour to
ascertain with the utmost precision all particulars respecting the
despatch or receipt of the lost letters or papers, and lose no time in
communicating this information to the Inspector. Indeed, generally
speaking, it is only by careful inquiry into minute details that the
offender can be detected, whether he be a servant of the Department or
not.


[Sidenote: Improvements.]

The Post Office is a department which admits of constant improvement and
expansion. The public, by sending to the Postmaster General, clear and
correct information respecting faulty arrangements, may materially
benefit the service. It must be remembered, however, that changes in
machinery so extensive and intricate as that of the Post Office, must be
made cautiously and with much previous consideration.

Time is generally required to carry out any material change in postal
arrangements; for even when decided upon, old contracts, requiring
notice of termination, may have to be got rid off, and tenders for new
contracts invited by public advertisement, before the decision can take
effect.


[Sidenote: New post offices.]

New Post Offices are established by the Department wherever it is
ascertained that a sufficient number of inhabitants can be accommodated,
and a sufficient amount of postal revenue collected to warrant such a
measure. When a new Post Office is required, a petition should be
addressed to the Postmaster General, signed by as many of the
inhabitants as can conveniently subscribe the same. The petition should
state the name of the township and the number of the lot and concession
on which it is desired the office should be established; the distance
from the neighbouring offices; whether at the site of the proposed Post
Office there is a village; the number of mills, stores, taverns, and
houses thereat; the extent of the settlement to be served and the
probable cost of the mail; together with any other facts which may form
any ground for the accommodation applied for.

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
