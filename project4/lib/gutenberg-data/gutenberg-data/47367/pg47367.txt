PREFACE.


It is much to be regretted, that of late years, so little attention has
been given in this country, to the study of pomology, and that so few
efforts have been made to encourge a taste for this most important,
most instructive, and intellectual branch of horticultural science.

Towards the end of the last, and beginning of the present century, when
the late Mr. Knight was in the full vigor of his scientific pursuits,
this was the subject which engaged so much of his powerful intellect,
and from which he succeeded in producing such great and beneficial
results. With Mr. Knight as president, and Mr. Sabine as secretary,
the Horticultural Society of London did much for the advancement of
this subject, and in extending a knowledge not only of the fruits of
this country, but of the most valuable varieties of the continent of
Europe, and America. Through the exertions of these gentlemen, and in
conjunction with the illustrious pomologists, Dr. Diel and Professor
Van Mons, and other eminent continental correspondents, was obtained
that vast collection of fruits which once existed in the Society’s
garden; and by means of which that great undertaking of determining and
arranging the nomenclature was accomplished. During this period the
Society’s Transactions teemed with rich, and interesting pomological
papers, and several works of a high character were ushered into
existence. Of these the most important were the Pomonas of Brookshaw
and Hooker, the Pomological Magazine, and Ronalds’s Pyrus Malus
Brentfordiensis; but these are all of such a class, as from their great
cost to be regarded more as works of art, than of general utility. The
only one which was at all calculated to be of general benefit was,
Lindley’s “Guide to the Orchard;” a work which furnished descriptions
of, and embraced a greater number of varieties than had hitherto been
attempted. This then may be regarded as the most complete work for
general reference, with which pomologists in this country had ever been
furnished.

Upwards of twenty years have now elapsed since the “Guide to the
Orchard” issued from the press, and during that period, Knight, Sabine,
and many great patrons of pomology have entered into their rest,
leaving none behind them to prosecute, with the same vigour, that
study which they so much loved and adorned. But although there has
been no corporate effort to promote and stimulate this study, private
enterprize has not altogether been awanting to keep pace with the rapid
progression of the Continent and America; but for this, we might yet
have been in total ignorance of many of the most desirable fruits of
modern times, and particularly of those valuable varieties, the result
of the later labors of Van Mons, Esperen, and others; together with
several of considerable merit, furnished by the fertile pomology of the
New World.

Since the publication of Lindley’s “Guide,” therefore, there has
not only been such additions to our varieties of fruits, but such a
complete reformation and arrangement of pomological nomenclature as
to have rendered that book, as a work of reference of considerably
less value; and it was on account of the necessity for a new work,
adapted to the wants of the present day, and embracing the most
recent information on the subject, that I entered upon the present
undertaking. The facilities I have possessed for carrying it out,
are perhaps greater than fall to the lot of most men. My earliest
associations were with fruits and fruit trees; the greater part of my
active life has been engaged in their cultivation and devoted to their
study; and for nearly ten years, I had the advantage of making an
annual tour throughout the length and breadth of England and Scotland,
during which, I allowed no opportunity to escape of making myself
acquainted with the fruits of the various districts, and securing
correspondents to whom I could apply, in cases of necessity. With these
advantages, I some years ago established an orchard, for the purpose of
examining the distinctive characters and determining the nomenclature
of fruits; and there I have succeeded, in securing all the varieties it
is possible to procure, either in this country or abroad, and thereby
to obtain from personal observation all the information attainable on
the subject.

In the execution of this work, my object has been, not to give a mere
selection of the best varieties of fruits cultivated in this country,
but to describe minutely, and at length, all the varieties with their
essential characters, distinguishing those which are, and those which
are not worthy of cultivation. I have endeavoured to embrace all the
fruits which are recorded as existing in Great Britain, and although it
cannot be supposed I have been able to obtain the whole of them, still,
I have secured such a number as will leave but a very small portion
un-noticed. The plan which I have adopted in the general arrangement
will be found to embrace all matters both descriptive, historical,
and critical, touching the several varieties. The nomenclature I have
followed is, except in some instances for reasons given, that of the
London Horticultural Society’s Catalogue, a valuable work prepared by
that patient and indefatigable pomologist, Mr. Robert Thompson. The
advantage of this identity of nomenclature is evident, as it sets at
rest that mass of confusion, which so long existed as to the correct
names of fruits. In describing each variety, the approved name, that
is the name which shall serve as a standard by which that variety
shall in future be distinguished, is printed in Roman Capitals; and
either abbreviated, or in full length, is annexed the name of the
author who first records or describes it. When the variety is of such
antiquity as not to be identified with any particular author, the
name of the one who first distinctly describes it is given. Following
the standard name, is the identification or list of works in which the
variety is identified as being described; the synonymes or names by
which it is mentioned in all works on pomology, or known in various
districts; and then a list of works in which it is most correctly and
faithfully figured. Then follow the description, history, and critical
observations, when such are necessary. I have furnished diagrams, of
the newest, rarest, and most esteemed varieties; and this mode of
illustration conveys a better idea of the general character of the
fruit, than a fore-shortened drawing, and answers the same purpose as
a highly finished engraving, without swelling the price of the work to
such an extent, as to render it unavailable for ordinary use. At the
end, I have given lists of the most excellent varieties adapted for
various districts of the country, as also such as are suited for being
grown as Standards, Dwarfs, and for Cyder. The whole work is terminated
by a copious index, which includes all the synonymes, and which of
itself, will afford much valuable assistance, in all matters relating
to pomological nomenclature.

It now remains for me to acknowledge the favors I have received from
many kind friends, who have, by furnishing materials and information,
rendered me much valuable assistance. To Mr. Robert Thompson, already
mentioned, I am particularly indebted for the liberal way in which
he has always supplied me with any information I required. To the
late Mr. John Ronalds, of Brentford, for the free use of his valuable
collection; as also to his excellent and much respected foreman,
Mr. William Waring. To Mr. James Lake, nurseryman, of Bridgewater,
for specimens of, and communications respecting the fruits of the
Somerset, Devon, and West of England orchards. To Mr. William
Fairbread, of Green-street, near Sittingbourne, for those of the
great orchard districts of Kent. To Mr. Mannington, of Uckfield, and
Mr. Henry Barton, of Heathfield, Sussex, for the fruits of these
neighbourhoods. To Mr. J. C. Wheeler, of Gloucester, and the late
Mr. Hignell, orchardist, of Tewkesbury. To George Jefferies, Esq.,
of Marlborough Terrace, Kensington, for some of the valuable fruits
of Norfolk; and to the Rev. Henry Manton, of Sleaford. To Mr. Roger
Hargreave, of Lancaster, for a complete collection from the Lancashire
orchards. To Archibald Turnbull, Esq., of Belwood, near Perth, whose
choice and extensive collection, was freely placed at my disposal.
To Mr. A. Gorrie, of Annat, and Robert Mathew, Esq., of Gourdiehill,
in the Carse of Gowrie, for much valuable information, and specimens
of the fruits of that great orchard district of the North. To Mr.
Evans, superintendent of the Caledonian Horticultural Society’s
Garden, Edinburgh, for much valuable assistance derived from a free
inspection of the collection of the Society. To my brother, Mr. Thomas
Hogg, of Coldstream, for the fruits of the Tweedside orchards, and to
numerous nurserymen and private individuals, who have aided me in the
prosecution of this work, I now tender my warmest and heartfelt thanks.

                                                              R. H.

THE APPLE.


There is no fruit, in temperate climates, so universally esteemed,
and so extensively cultivated, nor is there any which is so closely
identified with the social habits of the human species as the apple.
Apart from the many domestic purposes to which it is applicable,
the facility of its cultivation, and its adaptation to almost every
latitude, have rendered it, in all ages, an object of special attention
and regard. There is no part of our island where one or other of its
numerous varieties is not cultivated, and few localities where the
finest cannot be brought to perfection.

The apple is a native of this, as well as almost every other country
in Europe. Its normal form is the Common Wild Crab, the _Pyrus Malus_
of Linnæus, and the numerous varieties with which our gardens and
orchards abound, are the result either of the natural tendency of
that tree to variation, or by its varieties being hybridized with
the original species, or with each other. It belongs to the natural
order _Rosaceæ_, section _Pomeæ_, and is, by botanists, included in
the same genus as the pear. The principal difference between apples
and pears, when considered botanically, consists in their stamens and
styles; the stamens of the apple have their filaments straight, united
together at the base, and forming a bundle round the styles, of which
they conceal the inferior part. All the filaments of the pear on the
contrary are divergent, disposed almost like the radii of a wheel, and
leave the bases of the styles entirely naked and exposed. The styles
in the apple are united at their base into one body, and are generally
villous in that part where they adhere to each other: in the pear,
however, they are separate at their base. But although the apple and
pear very much resemble each other in their botanical characters, they
differ very materially in their form, cellular tissue, and specific
gravity. Apples have always the base umbellicate, or hollowed with
a deep cavity, in which the stalk is inserted, and are generally
spherical. The pear, on the other hand, is elongated towards the stalk,
and is generally of a pyramidal shape, or nearly so. The cellular
tissue of the apple, according to the microscopical observations
of Turpin, is composed of a great number of agglomerated, distinct
vesicles, each existing independent of the other, varying in size in
the same fruit, and, in general, larger, as the apple is large and
light. These vesicles are colorless and transparent, and vary in their
form according to the want of space requisite for their individual
development. They contain in greater or less abundance, a sugary, acid,
or bitter juice, which is perceivable in the different varieties. The
cellular tissue of the apple possesses no stony concretions, and its
specific gravity is greater than that of the pear; so much so, that by
taking a cube of each, of equal size, and throwing them into a vessel
of water, that of the apple will float, while that of the pear will
sink. In its natural or wild state the apple tree is of a small size,
attaining generally about twenty feet in height, of a crooked habit of
growth, with small, harsh, and austere fruit, and small thin leaves.
But when improved by cultivation, it loses much of its original form,
assumes a more free and luxuriant growth, with larger, thicker, and
more downy leaves, and produces fruit distinguished for its size,
color, and richness of flavor.

Some authors have ascribed the introduction of the apple into this
country to the Romans, and others to the Normans; in both cases,
however, without any evidence or well grounded authority. Mr. Loudon
says, “The apple was, in all probability, introduced into Britain
by the Romans, as well as the pear; and like that fruit, perhaps,
re-introduced by the heads of religious houses on their establishment,
after the introduction of christianity.”[A] It is more probable that
it has existed as an indigenous tree throughout all ages, and that
the most ancient varieties were accidental variations of the original
species, with which the forests abounded. These being cultivated, and
subjected to the art and industry of man, would give rise to other
varieties, and thus a gradual amelioration of the fruit would be
obtained. The earliest records make mention of the apple in the most
familiar terms. That it was known to the ancient Britons, before the
arrival of the Romans is evident from their language. In Celtic, it is
called _Abhall_, or _Abhal_; in Welch, _Avall_; in Armoric, _Afall_
and _Avall_; in Cornish, _Aval_ and _Avel_. The word is derived from
the pure Celtic, _ball_, signifying any round body.[B] The ancient
Glastonbury was called by the Britons Ynys Avallaç, and Ynys Avallon,
which signify an apple orchard,[C] and from this its Roman name
_Avallonia_ was derived. The apple must therefore have been known in
Britain before the arrival of the Romans; and that it continued to
exist after they left the island, and before the Norman conquest, is
certified by William of Malmesbury, who says, that King Edgar in 973,
while hunting in a wood was left alone by his associates; in this
situation he was overcome by an irresistable desire to sleep, and
alighting from his horse he lay down under the shade of a _wild apple
tree_.[D] Shortly after the Norman conquest, the same author writes
with reference to Gloucestershire. “Cernas tramites publicos vestitos
pomiferis arboribus, non insitiva manus industria, sed ipsius solius
humi natura.” Some writers[E] entertain the popular error that the
cultivation of apples was not a branch of rural economy in England
before Richard Harris planted orchards in several parts of Kent, in the
reign of Henry the Eighth; but there is evidence to the contrary. In
a bull of Pope Alexander the Third, in the year 1175, confirming the
property belonging to the monastery of Winchcombe, in Gloucestershire,
is mentioned, “The town of Twining with all the lands, _orchards_,
meadows, &c.;”[F] and in a charter of King John, granting property to
the priory of Lanthony, near Gloucester, is mentioned “the church
of Herdesley, with twelve acres of land, _and an orchard_.”[G] But
its cultivation was not confined to the southern counties, for we
find there was an extensive manufacture of cider as far north as
Richmond, in Yorkshire, in the early part of the thirteenth century.
It would be too much to say that all the varieties cultivated at an
early period, were indigenous to this country; many no doubt, were
introduced at the Norman conquest, and it is probable that in the
middle ages some varieties were introduced from the continent, by
members of the different religious houses which then existed, who not
unfrequently had personal intercourse with France, and who devoted
considerable attention to horticulture; but there is every reason to
believe that the earliest varieties were native productions. The oldest
works which treat on the cultivation of fruits, afford little or no
information as to these early varieties. In some ancient documents of
the twelfth century, we find the Pearmain[H] and Costard mentioned,
but the horticultural works of the period are too much occupied with
the fallacies and nonsense which distinguish those of the Roman
agricultural writers, to convey to us any knowledge of the early
pomology of this country. Turner in his Herbal, has no record of any of
the varieties, and simply states, in reference to the apple, “I nede
not to descrybe thys tre, because it is knowen well inoughe in all
countres.” Barnaby Googe mentions as, “Chiefe in price, the Pippin, the
Romet, the Pomeroyall, the Marigold, with a great number of others that
were too long to speake of.” Leonarde Mascal gives instruction how “to
graffe the Quyne Apple;” but that is the only variety he mentions. In
a note book in the possession of Sir John Trevelyan, of Nettlecombe,
near Taunton, which was kept by one of his ancestors, from the year
1580 to 1584, is an entry of “The names of Apelles, which I had their
graffes from Brentmarch, from one Mr. Pace--_Item_, the Appell out
of Essex; Lethercott, or Russet Apell; Lounden Peppen; Kew Goneling,
or the Croke; Glass Appell or Pearmeane; Red Stear; Nemes Appell, or
Grenlinge; Bellabone; Appell out of Dorsettsher; Domine quo Vadis.” In
“The Husbandman’s Fruitfull Orchard,” we have Pippins, Pearemains,
John Apples, Winter Russetings, and Leather Coats. Gerard enumerates
and figures “The Pome Water, the Baker’s Ditch, the King of Apples, the
Quining or Queene of Apples, the Sommer Pearemaine,” and “the Winter
Pearemaine;” and he says, “I have seene in the pastures and hedgerowes
about the grounds of a worshippfull gentleman, dwelling two miles from
Hereford, called _M. Roger Bednome_, so many trees of all sortes, that
the seruants drinke for the most part no other drinke, but that which
is made of Apples. The quantitie is such, that by the report of the
gentleman himselfe, the parson hath for tithe many hogsheads of Syder.”

But it is to Parkinson we are indebted for the best account of
the early English varieties, of which he enumerates no less than
fifty-nine, with “tweenty sorts of sweetings and none good;” and from
him may be dated the dawn of British Pomology. Hartlib mentions one who
had 200 sorts of apples, and was of opinion that 500 sorts existed.
Rea, in his Pomona, enumerates twenty varieties, sixteen of which are
not mentioned by Parkinson; and Meager gives a list of eighty-three,
which were cultivated in the Brompton Park, and some other nurseries
round London, of which fifty-one are not found in the lists of either
Parkinson or Rea. Worlidge mentions ninety-two, which are chiefly
cider fruits. The seventy-seven varieties of Ray are much the same as
those enumerated by Worlidge. During the last century, the writings
of Switzer, Langley, Hitt, Miller, and Abercrombie, added little to
what have already been noticed, except that Switzer first mentions
the Nonpareil; and it is to Forsyth that we are indebted for a more
extended knowledge of the different varieties, then known to exist in
this country. With Thomas Andrew Knight, Esq., the first President of
the London Horticultural Society, a new era in the history of pomology
commenced, and during his lifetime there was more attention devoted to
this study, than had been since the days of Evelyn and De Quintinye.
It was with this zealous horticulturist, that a practical application
of the discovery of the sexes of plants, was first systematically
carried into operation; and the success which attended his labors in
hybridization, is evinced by the many valuable varieties of fruits
which he was the means of producing. Through the exertions of this
gentleman, and his illustrious cotemporaries, Sabine, Williams, and
Braddick, the gardens of the Horticultural Society, became a depository
for all the varieties which could be gathered together from all parts
of Europe and America, and the result has been, that in the last
edition of the Society’s Catalogue, Mr. Thompson has enumerated upwards
of 1400 varieties of the apple alone, the greater portion of which,
however, are proved to be unworthy of cultivation for any purpose
whatever.

The apple is a very wholesome fruit. In its raw state it is highly
esteemed in the dessert, and when either roasted, boiled, or in pies,
it forms an excellent and nutritious food. Dr. Johnson says he knew a
clergyman, of small income, who brought up a family very reputably,
which he chiefly fed on apple dumplings! Administered to invalids it
is cooling, refreshing, and laxative. It is well known as furnishing
an excellent sauce; and apple jelly forms one of the finest preserves.
Norfolk Beefings are that variety of apple baked in ovens, after the
bread is drawn, and flattened to the form in which they are sold in the
shops of the confectioners and fruiterers. In Normandy and America,
apples are to a considerable extent dried in the sun, in which state
they may be preserved for a long period and used at pleasure, when
they form an excellent dish stewed with sugar, cloves, and other
spices. Those dried in America are cut into quarters, while those of
Normandy are preserved whole. There is a drink with which our ancestors
were wont to regale themselves called _Lambs-wool_, or more properly
_Lamasool_, a word derived from _La maes Abhal_, which signifies the
day of apple fruit. This drink was composed of ale and the pulp of
roasted apples, with sugar and spice. It is mentioned by Gerard, and in
an old song, called “The King and the Miller,” we find it referred to

    “A cup of _Lambs-wool_ they drank to him there.”

Besides these, and many other uses to which the apple is applied, its
juice produces cider, which forms, in many parts of this country, in
Normandy, and the United States, an indispensable beverage. The juice
of the wild species, called crab vinegar, or verjuice, when applied
externally is good for strains, spasms, and cramps.

The chemical composition of the apple is, chlorophylle, sugar, gum,
vegetable fibre, albumen, malic acid, tannin and gallic acid, lime, and
a great quantity of water.

The apple may be grown on almost any description of soil, provided
it is not absolutely wet. That on which it succeeds best is a humid
sandy loam, or a well-drained strong clay, which if it possesses a
calcareous, or gravelly subsoil, will be still more advantageous. It
is not requisite that it should be of so great depth as for pears, as
the apple, having no tap-root, does not penetrate so far into the soil.
From eighteen inches to two feet will be found a good depth; but where
the soil is good, and the subsoil sufficiently humid without being
literally wet, even a foot to eighteen inches will answer every purpose.




CLASSIFICATION OF APPLES.


A great desideratum in pomological science is, a system of
classification for the apple, founded on characters which are at once
permanent and well defined. The Germans have been most assiduous
in endeavoring to attain this object, and many systems have been
suggested, of which those of Manger, Sickler, Christ, and Diel, are
most generally known. But it is to Diel that the greatest merit is
due, for having produced a system, which, though far from perfect, is
greatly in advance of any which had hitherto been produced; and which
has been universally adopted by all the German pomologists. In 1847,
my friend Dochnahl, an eminent and assiduous pomologist, published a
system, based upon that of Diel, of which it is a modification, and
which possesses such advantages over its type, as to be more easily
reduced to practise.

As the systems of Diel and Dochnahl, are certainly the best which have
yet appeared, I have introduced them here, for the benefit of those who
may want a groundwork on which to form an arrangement.


DIEL’S CLASSIFICATION.


CLASS I. RIBBED APPLES.

1. They are furnished with very prominent, but regular ribs round the
eye, extending also over the fruit, but which do not render the shape
irregular.--2. Having wide, open, and very irregular cells.


ORDER I. TRUE CALVILLES.

1. They taper from about the middle of the fruit towards the eye.--2.
They are covered with bloom when on the tree.--3. They have, or acquire
by keeping, an unctuous skin.--4. They are not distinctly and purely
striped.--5. They have light, spongy, delicate flesh.--6. They have a
strawberry or raspberry flavor.


ORDER II. SCHLOTTERÄPFEL.

1. The skin does not feel unctuous.--2. They are not covered with
bloom.--3. They are either of a flat, conical, cylindrical, or tapering
form.--4. They have not a balsamic, but mostly a sweetish or sourish
flavor.--5. They have a granulous, loose, and coarse-grained flesh.


ORDER III. GULDERLINGE.

1. They are not balsamic like Order I., but of an aromatic flavor.--2.
They have a fine flesh, almost like that of the Reinettes.--3. They are
either of a conical or flat shape.--4. They are most prominently ribbed
round the eye.

summer, or autumn apples.--9. They are mostly striped like a tulip.


ORDER I. FRUIT TAPERING OR OBLONG.


ORDER II. FRUIT ROUND OR FLAT.


CLASS III. RAMBOURS.

1. They are all large apples, and comprise the largest sorts.--2. They
have mostly, or almost always, two unequal halves, namely one side
lower than the other.--3. They are constantly furnished with ribs
round the eye, which are broad, rising irregularly the one above the
other, and extending over the fruit, so as to render it irregular in
its shape; they are also compressed and have one side higher than the
other.--4. They are constantly broader than high, and only sometimes
elongated.--5. They have all a loose, coarse-grained, and often very
pleasant flesh.


ORDER I. WITH WIDE CELLS.


ORDER II. WITH NARROW CELLS.


CLASS IV. REINETTES.

1. They have a fine-grained, delicate, crisp, firm, or tender
flesh.--2. They are mostly the ideal of a handsome shaped apple; in
them the convexity or bulge of the middle of the apple, towards the
eye, is the same as that towards the stalk, or not much different.--3.
They are all grey dotted, or have russety patches, or completely
covered with russet.--4. They have only rarely an unctuous skin.--5.
They have all the rich, aromatic, sugary, and brisk flavor, which is
called the Reinette flavor--6. They decay very readily, and must, of
all apples, hang longest on the tree.--7. The really sweet, and at the
same time aromatic apples, belong to the Reinettes, only as regards
their shape, their russety character, and their fine or firm flesh.--8.
Apples with fine, firm, crisp flesh, which cannot of themselves form a
separate class,--for instance, the Pippins also belong to this class.


ORDER I. SELF COLORED REINETTES.

1. Having an uniform green ground color, which changes to the most
beautiful golden yellow.--2. Having no lively colors or marks of russet
on the side next the sun; except those that are very much exposed, and
which assume a slight tinge of red.--3. Having no covering of russet,
but only slight traces of russety stripes.

red on the side next the sun, without any mixture of russet.


ORDER III. GREY REINETTES.

1. Their ground color is green, changing to dingy dull yellow.--2. The
coating of russet, or the russety patches spread over the greater part
of the fruit are very conspicious.--3. The side next the sun is often
dull brownish, or ochreous red.


ORDER IV. GOLDEN REINETTES.

1. On the side next the sun they are washed, or striped with beautiful

yellow.--3. Over the ground color, and the crimson of the exposed side,
are spread light thin patches, or a complete coat of russet.


CLASS V. STREIFLINGE.--STRIPED APPLES.

1. They are all, and almost always, marked with broken stripes of
red.--2. These stripes are found either over the whole fruit, or only
very indistinctly on the side exposed to the sun.--3. The stripes may
be distinct, that is to say, truly striped; or between these stripes on
the side next the sun, the fruit is dotted, shaded, or washed with red;
but on the shaded side the stripes are well defined.--4. The cells are
regular.--5. They are of a purely sweet, vinous, or acid flavor.--6.
They have not the same flavor as the Rosenäpfel.--7. They do not decay
except when gathered before maturity, or after the period when properly
ripened.--8. They form a large and somewhat considerable class among
the culinary fruits.

stalk, and are broadly flattened.--2. They are constantly half an inch
broader than high.

same.--2. The breadth does not differ from the height, except only
about a quarter of an inch.--3. Laid in the hand with the eye and stalk
sideways, they have the appearance of a roundish shape.


CLASS VI. TAPERING APPLES.

1. They have the cells regular.--2. They are not covered with
bloom.--3. They are not striped, and are either of an uniform color, or
washed with red on the side next the sun.--4. Constantly diminishing to
a point towards the eye.--5. They are sweet, or vinous, approaching a
pure acid.--6. They do not decay readily.


ORDER I. OBLONG, CYLINDRICAL, OR CONICAL.

must therefore be left as long as possible on the tree.)--5. Their
flesh is fine-grained, crisp, firm, or fine and delicate.--6. They are
all charged with only a balsamic, sugary acid, which is called Reinette
flavored.


GROUP 1. FRUCTUS UNICOLORES.--_SELF COLORED._

1. Having an uniform green ground color, which changes to the most
beautiful golden yellow.--2. Having no lively colors nor marks of
russet, on the side next the sun; except those that are very much
exposed, and are slightly tinged with red.--3. Having no covering of
russet, but only slight traces of russety stripes.


GROUP 2. FRUCTUS RUBRI.--_FRUIT RED._

Having all the properties of the self colored Reinettes; but on the
side next the sun, they are of a red color, with a mixture of russet.


GROUP 3. FRUCTUS RAVI.--_FRUIT RUSSETED._

1. Their ground color is green, changing to dingy dull yellow.--2. The
coatings of russet are very conspicious.--3. The side next the sun is
often dingy, brownish, or ochreous-red.--4. They all decay very readily.


GROUP 4. FRUCTUS AUREI.--_YELLOW OR GOLDEN FRUIT._

GOLDEN REINETTES.

1. On the side next the sun they are washed or striped with beautiful
crimson.--2. The ground color changes by keeping, to beautiful deep
yellow.--3. Over the crimson there is a light, thin trace, or complete
covering of russet.


CLASS IV. MALA MALARIA.--_PERFECT OR PURE APPLE SHAPED._

They are of a perfectly sweet or vinous flavor, approaching to pure
acid.


ORDER I. STRIOLA.--_STRIPED APPLES._

1. They are all, and almost always, marked with broken stripes of
red.--2. These are either over the whole fruit, or only indistinctly
on the side exposed to the sun.--3. The stripes may all be distinct,
that is, clearly and finely striped; or between these stripes on the
side next the sun, the fruit is dotted, shaded, or washed with red;
but on the shaded side, the stripes are well defined.--4. The cells
are regular.--5. The fruit does not decay, except when gathered before
maturity, or after the period when it has been properly ripened.


GROUP 1. FRUCTUS DEPRESSI.--_FRUIT FLAT._

1. They have the bulge at the same distance from the eye, as from the
stalk, and are broadly flattened.--2. They are always half an inch
broader than high.


GROUP 2. FRUCTUS ACUMINATI.--_POINTED FRUIT._

1. They are broader than high.--2. They diminish from the middle of
the apple towards the eye, so that the superior half is conical or
pyramidal, and is not at all similiar to the inferior half.


GROUP 3. FRUCTUS OBLONGI.--_FRUIT OBLONG OR CYLINDRICAL._

1. The height and breadth are almost equal.--2. They diminish gradually
from the base to the apex.--3. Or from the middle of the fruit, they
gradually diminish towards the base and apex equally.


GROUP 4. FRUCTUS SPHÆRICI.--_FRUIT ROUND._

1. The convexity of the fruit next the base and the apex is the
same.--2. The breadth does not differ from the height, except only
about a quarter of an inch.--3. When laid on their sides they present a
spherical shape.


ORDER II. CONTUBERNALIA.--_STORING OR HOUSEHOLD APPLES._

1. Having the cells regular.--2. They are not striped, and are either
of an uniform color, or washed with red on the side next the sun.--3.
They do not decay readily.--4. They are not unctuous when handled.--5.
They are never covered with bloom.


GROUP 1. FRUCTUS ACUMINATI.--_FRUIT TAPERING._

Diminishing towards the eye.


GROUP 2. FRUCTUS DEPRESSI.--_FRUIT FLAT._

They are constantly broader than high.

Such is the classification of Dochnahl, and although it is not all
that could be desired, it is certainly the best which has yet been
published, and will serve as a good foundation on which to raise a more
perfect work.

I have not had an opportunity of applying either of these arrangements
to the classification of our British apples, but for the purpose of
affording a little assistance in identifying the different varieties
described in this work, I have prepared the following, which, although
I am aware is not what could be desired, will at least be sufficient
for all general purposes. The period of duration, and the coloring of
fruits, vary to a considerable extent according to circumstances of
soil, situation, and season; but in the following arrangement, I have
endeavored to embrace those characters which they are most generally
found to possess.

THE APPLE.--ITS VARIETIES.


1. ACKLAM’S RUSSET.--Fors.

 IDENTIFICATION.--Fors. Treat. 92. Lind. Guide, 85. Hort. Soc. Cat. ed.
 3, n. 733.

 SYNONYME.--Aclemy Russet, _Gibs. Fr. Gard._ 359.

Fruit, below the medium size, two inches and a quarter wide, and two
inches high; round and somewhat flattened. Skin, pale yellow tinged
with green, and covered with thin grey russet, particularly on the side
exposed to the sun. Eye, small and closed, set in a smooth, round, and
shallow basin. Stalk, short, inserted in a moderately deep cavity.
Flesh, white with a greenish tinge, firm, crisp, juicy, and highly
flavoured.

An excellent dessert apple of first-rate quality; ripe in November, and
will keep under favourable circumstances till March.

The tree is very hardy, and an excellent bearer. It succeeds best in a
dry soil, and is well adapted for espalier training.

This variety is supposed to have originated at the village of Acklam,
in Yorkshire.


2. ADAMS’S PEARMAIN.--Lind.

 IDENTIFICATION.--Lind. Guide, 60. Hort. Soc. Cat. ed. 3, n. 529.

 SYNONYME.--Norfolk Pippin, _Hort. Soc. Cat._ ed. 1, 685.

 FIGURE.--Pom. Mag. t. 133.

[Illustration]

Fruit, large, varying from two inches and a half to three inches high
and about the same in breadth at the widest part; pearmain-shaped,
very even, and regularly formed. Skin, pale yellow tinged with green,
and covered with delicate russet on the shaded side; but deep yellow
tinged with red, and delicately streaked with livelier red on the side
next the sun. Eye, small and open, with acute erect segments, set in
a narrow, round, and plaited basin. Stalk, varying from half an inch
to an inch long, obliquely inserted in a shallow cavity, and generally
with a fleshy protuberance on one side of it. Flesh, yellowish, crisp,
juicy, rich, and sugary, with an agreeable and pleasantly perfumed
flavor.

A dessert apple of first-rate quality; in use from December to
February. It is a large and very handsome variety, and worthy of
general cultivation.

The tree is a free and healthy grower, producing long slender shoots,
by which, and its cucullated ovate leaves, it is easily distinguished.
It is an excellent bearer even in a young state, particularly on the
paradise or doucin stock, and succeeds well as an espalier.


3. ALFRISTON.--Hort.

 IDENTIFICATION.--Hort. Soc. Cat. ed. 3, n. 8. Lind. Guide,
 26. Down. Fr. Amer. 97.

 SYNONYMES.--Lord Gwydyr’s Newtown Pippin, _Acc. Hort. Soc. Cat._ ed.
 3. Oldaker’s New, _Ibid._ Shepherd’s Pippin, _in Sussex_. Shepherd’s
 Seedling, _Ibid._

 FIGURE.--Ron. Pyr. Mal. pl. xxxv. f. 1.

[Illustration]

Fruit, of the largest size, generally about three inches and a half
wide, and from two and three quarters to three inches high; roundish,
and angular on the sides. Skin, greenish yellow on the shaded side,
and tinged with orange next the sun, covered all over with veins, or
reticulations of russet. Eye, open, set in a deep and uneven basin.
Stalk, short, inserted in a deep cavity. Flesh, yellowish white, crisp,
juicy, sugary, and briskly flavoured.

This is one of the largest and best culinary apples. It comes into use
in the beginning of November and continues till April.

The tree is a strong and vigorous grower, very hardy, and an abundant
bearer.

This variety is supposed to have been raised by a person of the name
of Shepherd, at Uckfield, in Sussex, and has for many years been
extensively cultivated in that county, under the names of _Shepherd’s
Seedling_, and _Shepherd’s Pippin_, two names by which it is there
most generally known. Some years ago a Mr. Brooker, of Alfriston,
near Hailsham, in Sussex, sent specimens of the fruit to the London
Horticultural Society, by whom, being unknown, it was called the
_Alfriston_, a name by which it is now generally known, except in its
native county. By some it is erroneously called the _Baltimore_ and
_Newtown Pippin_.


4. AMERICAN FALL PIPPIN.--H.

 SYNONYME.--Fall Pippin, _Coxe. View_, 109, _Down. Fr. Amer._ 84.

[Illustration]

Fruit, large, three inches and a quarter wide, and two inches and three
quarters high; roundish, ribbed on the sides, and almost the same width
at the apex as the base. Skin, yellow tinged with green, and strewed
with brown dots on the shaded side; but with a tinge of brown, and
numerous embedded pearly specks on the side next the sun. Eye, large
and open, with broad, flat segments, set in a wide, deep, and rather
angular basin. Stalk, three quarters of an inch long, inserted in a
rather shallow cavity, which is slightly marked with russet. Flesh,
yellowish, slightly tinged with green at the margin, tender, juicy,
sugary, slightly perfumed, and pleasantly flavoured.

Unlike the majority of American Apples, this comes to great perfection
in this country, and is a valuable and first-rate culinary apple. It is
ripe in October and will last till Christmas.

This is the true Fall Pippin of the American orchards, and a very
different variety from the Fall Pippin of this country, which is known
by the names of Cobbett’s Fall Pippin, and Reinette Blanche d’Espagne.


5. AMERICAN SUMMER PEARMAIN.--Ken.

 IDENTIFICATION.--Ken. Amer. Or. 1. Hort Soc. Cat. ed. 3. Down. Fr.
 Amer. 70.

 SYNONYME.--Early Summer Pearmain, _Coxe. View_, 104.

Fruit, medium sized; oblong, regularly and handsomely shaped. Skin,
yellow, covered with patches and streaks of light red, on the shaded
side; and streaked with fine bright red, interspersed with markings of
yellow on the side next the sun. Eye, set in a wide and deep basin.
Stalk, slender, inserted in a round and deep cavity. Flesh, yellow,
very tender, rich, and pleasantly flavored.

An excellent early apple, either for dessert or kitchen use. It is ripe
in the end of August, and will keep till the end of September.

The tree is a healthy grower, a prolific bearer, and succeeds well on
light soils.

[Illustration]

Fruit, small; oblate. Skin, thick, smooth, and shining, yellowish green
in the shade, changing to pale yellow as it attains maturity; and deep
glossy red, approaching to crimson, on the side next the sun. Eye,
small, set in a rather deep and plaited basin. Stalk, short, and deeply
inserted. Flesh, white, crisp, tender, sweet, very juicy, and slightly
perfumed.

A beautiful little dessert apple in use from October to April.

It should be eaten with the skin on, as it is there that the perfume is
contained. The skin is very sensitive of shade, and any device may be
formed upon it, by causing pieces of paper, in the form of the design
required, to adhere on the side exposed to the sun, before it has
attained its deep red color.

The tree is of a pyramidal habit of growth, healthy, and an abundant
bearer. It succeeds well in almost any situation, provided the soil
is rich, loamy, and not too light or dry; and may be grown with equal
success either on the doucin, or crab stock. When worked on the French
paradise it is well adapted for pot culture. The fruit is firmly
attached to the spurs and forcibly resists the effects of high winds.

It has been asserted, that this apple was brought from Peloponessus to
Rome, by Appius Claudius. Whether this be true or not, there can be no
doubt it is of great antiquity, as all the oldest authors regard it
as the production of an age prior to their own. Dalechamp and Harduin
are of opinion that it is the Petisia of Pliny; but J. Baptista Porta
considers it to be the Appiana of that author, who thus describes it,
“Odor est his cotoneorum magnitudo quæ Claudianis, color rubens.”[I]
From this description it is evident that two varieties are referred
to, the Appiana and Claudiana. Such being the case, J. Baptista Porta
says, “duo sunt apud nos mala, magnitudine, et colore paria, et
preciosa, quorum unum odorem servat cotoneorum, alterum minimè. Quod
odore caret, vulgo dictum _Melo rosa_. Id roseo colore perfusum est,
mira teneritudine et sapore, minimè fugax, pomum magnitudine media,
ut facile cum ceteris de principatu certet, nec indignum Claudii
nomine. Hoc Claudianum dicerem.”[J] This Melo Rosa may possibly be the
Pomme Rose or Gros Api; and if so, we may infer that the Api is the
_Appiana_, and the Gros Api the _Claudiana_ of Pliny. This, however,
may be mere conjecture, but as the authority referred to, was a native
of Naples, and may be supposed to know something of the traditionary
associations of the Roman fruits, I have deemed it advisable to record
his opinion on the subject. According to Merlet, the Api was first
discovered as a wilding in the Forest of Api, in Brittany.

Although mentioned by most of the early continental writers, the Api
does not appear to have been known in this country, till towards the
end of the 17th century. It is first mentioned by Worlidge, who calls
it “Pomme Appease, a curious apple, lately propagated; the fruit is
small and pleasant, which the Madams of France carry in their pockets,
by reason they yield no unpleasant scent.” Lister, in his “Journey to
Paris, 1698,” speaking of this as being one of the apples served up in
the dessert, says, “Also the Pome d’Apis, which is served here more
for show than for use; being a small flat apple, very beautiful, and
very red on one side, and pale or white on the other, and may serve the
ladies at their toilets as a pattern to paint by.” De Quintinye calls
it “Une Pomme des Damoiselles et de bonne compagnie.”

Under the name of _Lady Apple_, large quantities of the Api are
annually imported to this country from the United States, where it is
grown to a great extent, and produces a considerable return to the
growers, as it always commands the highest price of any other fancy
apple in the market. In the winter months, they may be seen encircled
with various coloured tissue papers, adorning the windows of the
fruiterers in Covent Garden Market.

There are other varieties mentioned by J. B. Porta as belonging to the
Api family; one which ripened in August, in size like the Claudiana
already mentioned, and commonly called _Melo Appio Rosso_, because it
retained the scent of the Api; this is probably the Rother Sommer-api
of Diel. There is another, of which he says, “Assererem tuto esse
Melapium Plinii,” and which was held in such estimation as to give rise
to the proverb--

    “Omme malum malum præter appium malum.”

 FIGURE.--Ron. Pyr. Mal. pl. xx. f. 1.

Fruit, below medium size, two inches and three quarters wide, and
two inches high; oblate. Skin, pale green, changing as it ripens to
pale yellow on the shaded side, and pale red, mottled with green,
where exposed to the sun. Eye, small and closed, set in a shallow and
plaited basin. Stalk, short, inserted in a wide, rather deep, and
russety cavity. Flesh, greenish, tender, crisp, very juicy, and briskly
flavored.

Suitable either for the dessert, or for culinary purposes; it is
inferior to the Api and not a first-rate apple. In use from December to
March. The tree has much similarity to the Api in its growth, and is a
good bearer.

This is a variety of the preceding, and closely resembles it in all
its parts, except that it is much larger. “La Pomme Rose resemble
extremement partout son exterieur a la Pomme d’Apis, mais à mon goût
elle ne la vaut pas quoy que puissent dire les curieux du Rhône, qui
la veulent autant élever aussi au dessus des autres, qu’ils élevent la
Poire Chat au dessus des autres Poires.”--_De Quintinye._

 _Ibid._ Gelber Sternförmiger Api, _Diel Kernobst._ B. iv. 31.
 Sternapfel, _Christ Handworter_, 106. _Hort. Soc. Cat._ ed. 3, n. 797.

This is a variety of the Api, from which it is distinguished by being
very much flattened, and furnished with five very prominent angles on
the sides, which give it the appearance of a star, hence its name. It
is of a deep yellow on the shaded side, and redish orange next the sun.
It is a well-flavored apple, but only of second-rate quality. It ripens
about the middle or end of September.

The variety received under this name by the London Horticultural
Society must have been incorrect, as in the last edition of their
catalogue it is made synonymous with Api Petit.


9. API NOIR.--Duh.

 IDENTIFICATION.--Duh. Arb. Fr. I. 311. Hort. Soc. Cat. ed. 3.

 SYNONYME.--Schwarzer Api, _Diel Kernobst._ ix. 214.

 FIGURE.--Poit et. Turp. pl. 137.

Fruit, small, but a little larger and somewhat flatter than the Api, to
which it bears a close resemblance. Skin, tender, smooth, and shining
as if varnished, and almost entirely covered, where exposed to the sun,
with very dark crimson, almost approaching to black, like the Pomme
Violette, but becoming paler towards the shaded side, where there is
generally a patch of light yellow; it is strewed with fawn-colored
dots, and some markings of russet. Eye, very small, set in a pretty
deep and plaited basin. Stalk, slender, about three quarters of an
inch long, inserted in a rather deep, wide, and funnel-shaped cavity,
which is slightly marked with russet. Flesh, pure white, firm and
juicy, tinged with red under the skin, and with a pleasant, vinous, and
slightly perfumed flavor.

A dessert apple, inferior to the Api, and cultivated merely for
curiosity. It is in use from November to April, but is very apt to
become meally.

The habit of the tree is similar to that of the Api, but it is rather a
larger grower.


10. AROMATIC RUSSET.--Lind.

 IDENTIFICATION.--Lind. Guide, 86. Rog. Fr. Cult. 105.

 FIGURE.--Ron. Pyr. Mal. pl. viii.

Fruit, medium sized, two inches and a half wide, and about two inches
and a quarter high; roundish-ovate, and flattened at both ends. Skin,
greenish yellow, almost entirely covered with brownish grey russet,
strewed with brownish scales on the shaded side, and slightly tinged
with brownish red, strewed with silvery scales on the side exposed to
the sun. Eye, small and open, with broad recurved segments, and set
in a rather shallow basin. Stalk, short, inserted in a deep and round
cavity. Flesh, greenish yellow, firm, crisp, brisk, sugary, and richly
aromatic.

A dessert apple of the first quality, in use from December to February.

The tree is very hardy and an abundant bearer.


11. ASHMEAD’S KERNEL.--Lind.

 IDENTIFICATION.--Lind. Guide, 86. Ron. Pyr. Mal. 63, but not of Hort.
 Soc. Cat. ed. 2.

 SYNONYME.--Dr. Ashmead’s Kernel, _in Gloucestershire_.

 FIGURE.--Ron. Pyr. Mal. pl. xxxii. f. 5.

[Illustration]

Fruit, below medium size; round and flattened, but sometimes
considerably elongated; the general character, however, is shown in
the accompanying figure. Skin, light greenish yellow, covered with
yellowish brown russet, and a tinge of brown next the sun. Eye, small
and partially open, placed in a moderately deep basin. Stalk, short,
inserted in a round and deep cavity. Flesh, yellowish, firm, crisp,
juicy, sugary, rich, and highly aromatic.

A dessert apple of the very first quality, possessing all the richness
of the Nonpareil, but with a more sugary juice. It comes into use in
November, but is in greatest perfection from Christmas till May.

The tree is very hardy, an excellent bearer, and will succeed in
situations unfavorable to the Nonpareil, to which its leaves and shoots
bear such a similarity, as to justify Mr. Lindley in believing it to be
a seedling from that variety.

This delightful apple was raised at Gloucester, about the beginning of
last century, by Dr. Ashmead, an eminent physician of that city. The
original tree existed within the last few years, in what had originally
been Dr. Ashmead’s garden, but was destroyed in consequence of the
ground being required for building. It stood on the spot now occupied
by Clarence Street. It is difficult to ascertain the exact period
when it was raised; but the late Mr. Hignell, an eminent orchardist
at Tewkesbury, in Gloucestershire, informed me, that the first time
he ever saw the fruit of Ashmead’s Kernel, was from a tree in the
nursery of Mr. Wheeler, of Gloucester, in the year 1796, and that the
tree in question had been worked from the original, and was at that
time upwards of thirty years old. From this it may be inferred that
the original tree had attained some celebrity by the middle of last
century. The Ashmead’s Kernel has long been a favorite apple in all
the gardens of West Gloucestershire, but it does not seem to have
been known in other parts of the country. Like the Ribston Pippin
it seems to have remained long in obscurity, before its value was
generally appreciated; it is not even enumerated in the catalogue of
the extensive collection which was cultivated by Miller and Sweet,
of Bristol, in 1790. I find it was cultivated in the Brompton Park
Nursery, in 1780, at which time it was received from Mr. Wheeler,
nurseryman, of Gloucester, who was author of “The Botanist’s and
Gardener’s Dictionary,” published in 1763, and grandfather of Mr. J.
Cheslin Wheeler, the present proprietor of the nursery, to whom I am
indebted for specimens of the fruit, and much valuable information
connected with the varieties cultivated in that district.


12. AUGUSTUS PEARMAIN--Hort.

 IDENTIFICATION.--Hort. Soc. Cat. ed. 3. p. 30.

[Illustration]

Fruit, below medium size; pearmain-shaped, regular and handsome. Skin,
thick and membranous, yellow in the shade, and marked with a few
broken stripes of red; but red, streaked all over with deeper red on
the side next the sun; it is dotted with grey dots, and sometimes
marked with patches of grey-colored russet, which is strewed with
scales of a darker color. Eye, small and closed, with long segments,
set in a narrow and even basin. Stalk, very short, not protruding
beyond the base, and having the appearance of a knob obliquely
attached. Flesh, tender, juicy, brisk, and vinous, with a pleasant
aromatic flavor.

A dessert apple, generally of only second-rate quality; but in some
seasons it is of a rich flavor and of first-rate quality.

It is in use from November to Christmas.


13. BACHELOR’S GLORY.--H.

Fruit, large, three inches wide, and two and three quarters high;
roundish and irregularly ribbed, generally higher on one side of the
eye than the other. Skin, smooth and shining, striped with deep golden
yellow, and crimson stripes. Eye, closed, with broad flat segments, and
set in a plaited, irregular, and angular basin. Stalk, about half an
inch long, deeply inserted in a funnel-shaped cavity, which is lined
with rough scaly russet. Flesh, yellow, tender, juicy, and pleasantly
flavored.

A second-rate fruit, suitable either for the dessert or culinary
purposes; in use from October to November.

This is a variety grown in the neighbourhood of Lancaster, where
it is much esteemed, but in the southern districts, where the more
choice varieties can be brought to perfection, it can only rank as a
second-rate fruit.


14. BADDOW PIPPIN.--H.

 SYNONYME.--Spring Ribston, _Riv. Cat._ 1848.

[Illustration]

Fruit, medium sized; roundish or rather oblate, with prominent ribs on
the sides, which terminate in four, and sometimes five considerable
ridges at the crown, very much in the character of the London Pippin.
It is sometimes of an ovate shape, caused by the stalk being prominent
instead of depressed, in which case the ribs on the sides, and ridges
round the eye, are less apparent. Skin, deep lively green, changing
as it ripens to yellowish green, on the shaded side; but covered on
the side next the sun with dull red, which changes to orange where it
blends with the yellow ground; the whole considerably marked with thin
brown russet, and russety dots. Eye, rather large and open, with short
segments, and set in an angular basin. Stalk, very short, not more than
a quarter of an inch long, and inserted in a shallow cavity. Flesh,
greenish white, firm, crisp, juicy, sugary, and with a particularly
rich and vinous flavor, partaking somewhat of the Nonpareil and
Ribston, but particularly the latter.

This is a first-rate dessert apple, in use in November, and possessing
the desirable property of keeping till April or May.

This variety originated in the garden of Mr. John Harris, of
Broomfield, near Chelmsford, and was first introduced to public notice
in the autumn of 1848.


15. BALDWIN.--Ken.

 IDENTIFICATION.--Ken. Amer. Or. 41. Hort. Soc. Cat. ed. 3, n. 22.
 Down. Fr. Amer. 98.

 SYNONYMES.--Red Baldwin, _Acc. Hort. Soc. Cat._ ed. 2. Butter’s,
 _Ibid._ Woodpecker, _Ibid._

Fruit, large, three inches and a half wide, and about three inches
high; ovato-conical. Skin, smooth, yellow on the shaded side; and on
the side next the sun, deep orange, covered with stripes of bright red,
which sometimes extend over the whole surface to the shaded side, and
marked with large russety dots. Eye, closed, set in a deep, narrow,
and plaited basin. Stalk, about an inch long, slender, and inserted in
a deep cavity, from which issue ramifying patches of russet. Flesh,
yellowish, crisp, juicy, and pleasantly acid, with a rich and agreeable
flavor.

A culinary apple, in season from November to March. The tree is
vigorous, and an abundant bearer; but like the generality of the
American sorts, it does not attain the size, or flavor in this country,
which it does in its native soil.

This is considered one of the finest apples in the Northern States of
America, and is extensively grown in Massachussets, for the supply of
the Boston Market.


16. BANK APPLE.--H.

Fruit, medium sized, two inches and three quarters wide, and about
two inches and a half high; roundish-ovate, regularly and handsomely
formed. Skin, greenish yellow, with a blush and faint streaks of
red next the sun, dotted all over with minute dots, and marked with
several large spots of rough russet; the base is covered with a
coating of russet, strewed with silvery scales. Eye, large and open,
set in a shallow and plaited basin. Stalk, half an inch long, obliquely
inserted by the side of a fleshy prominence. Flesh, firm, crisp, brisk,
juicy, and pleasantly acid, resembling the Winter Greening in flavor.

It is an excellent culinary apple, in use from November to February;
but as it has nothing to recommend it, in preference to other varieties
already in cultivation, it need only be grown in large collections.

The original tree was produced from a pip, accidentally sown in the
home nursery of Messrs. Ronalds, of Brentford, and from growing on a
bank by the side of a ditch, it was called the _Bank Apple_.

[Illustration]

Fruit, of medium size; oval. Skin, clear pale yellow, mottled with
red in the shade; but dark red next the sun, the whole covered with
numerous star-like russety specks, those on the shaded side being
brownish, and those next the sun yellow. Eye, small and open, with
erect acuminate segments, and set in a round, even, and pretty deep
basin. Stalk, about an inch long, slender, inserted in a rather shallow
cavity, which is lined with russet. Flesh, yellowish white, firm,
crisp, very juicy, and with a rich, vinous, and highly aromatic flavor.

One of the best dessert apples, and equally valuable for culinary
purposes. It comes to perfection about the end of November, and
continues in use till March.

The tree is a free grower, but does not attain the largest size. It is
very hardy, an abundant bearer, and succeeds well either as a standard
or an espalier.

In the third edition of the Horticultural Society’s Catalogue, this is
said to be the same as Reinette Rouge. I do not think that it is the
Reinette Rouge of the French, which Duhamel describes as being white,
or clear yellow in the shade, having often prominent ribs round the
eye, which extend down the sides, so as to render the shape angular; a
character at variance with that of the Barcelona Pearmain. But I have
no doubt of it being the Reinette Rousse of the same author, which is
described at page 302, vol. 1, as a variety of Reinette Franche, and
which he says is of an elongated shape, skin marked with a great number
of russety spots, the most part of which are of a longish figure, so
much so, when it is ripe, it appears as if variegated with yellow and
red; a character in every way applicable to the Barcelona Pearmain.


18. BARTON’S INCOMPARABLE.--Hort.

 IDENTIFICATION.--Hort. Soc. Cat. ed. 3, n. 352?

[Illustration]

Fruit, below medium size; in shape somewhat like a Golden Knob, ovate
or conical, with prominent ribs on the sides, which terminate in five
ridges round the eye. Skin, yellowish green, covered with patches of
pale brown russet, thickly strewed with large russety freckles, like
the Barcelona Pearmain, and tinged with orange next the sun. Eye,
small, partially open, with reflexed segments, set in a narrow and
angular basin. Stalk, nearly three quarters of an inch long, inserted
in a narrow and round cavity. Flesh, yellowish white, tender, crisp,
brittle, very juicy, and when eaten is quite a mouthful of lively,
vinous juice.

A dessert apple of the highest excellence, in use from October to
February.

The tree is a good and healthy grower, attains a considerable size, and
is an excellent bearer.

This variety seems to be but little known, and considering its
excellence rarely cultivated. I am not aware that it exists in any of
the nurseries, or that it was at any period extensively propagated. The
only place where I ever met with it was, in the private garden of the
late Mr. Lee, of Hammersmith, whence I procured grafts from a tree in
the last stage of decay.

 IDENTIFICATION.--G. Lind. in Hort. Trans. vol. iv., p. 67. Lind.
 Guide, 62. Hort. Soc. Cat. ed. 3, n. 533.

Fruit, large, three inches and a quarter wide, and three inches high;
roundish-ovate, and slightly angular. Skin, pale green, but tinged
with red, and marked with a few indistinct streaks of darker red, on
the side exposed to the sun. Eye, open, with long spreading segments,
and placed in a moderately deep basin. Stalk, short and thick, not
deeply inserted. Flesh, yellowish, firm, brisk, and sugary, and with an
abundance of pleasantly acid juice.

An excellent apple, suitable either for culinary purposes, or the
dessert; in use from November to March.

The tree is hardy, vigorous, a most abundant bearer, and even in
seasons when other varieties fail, this is almost safe to ensure a
plentiful crop. It is extensively cultivated in Norfolk, and deserves
to be more generally known in other districts of the country.

 FIGURES.--Pom. Mag. t. 82. Ron. Pyr. Mal. pl. xxvii. f. 6.

Fruit, small, about two inches wide, and the same in height; ovate,
handsomely and regularly formed. Skin, greenish yellow, covered with
patches and dots of russet, particularly round the eye. Eye, small and
open, set in a shallow, narrow, and even basin. Stalk, about half an
inch long, almost embedded in a round cavity. Flesh, yellowish white,
tender, crisp, and very juicy, with a rich, brisk, and sugary flavor.

A rich and deliciously flavored dessert apple, of the highest
excellence; in use from December to March.

The tree is perfectly hardy, a healthy and vigorous grower, but does
not attain a large size; it is an excellent bearer.

This variety was raised by John Motteux, Esq., of Beachamwell, in
Norfolk, where, according to Mr. George Lindley, the original tree
still existed in 1831. It is not very generally cultivated, but ought
to form one even in the smallest collections.

 SYNONYME.--Kentish Pippin, of some, _Acc. Hort. Soc. Cat._

 FIGURES.--Brook. Pom. Brit. pl. xc. f. 6. Ron. Pyr. Mal. pl. xv. f. 1.

[Illustration]

Fruit, large; roundish-ovate, broad and flattened at the base, and
narrowing towards the apex, where it is terminated by several prominent
angles. Skin, deep yellow slightly tinged with green, and marked with
faint patches of red, on the shaded side; but entirely covered with
deep red, except where there are a few patches of deep yellow, on the
side next the sun. Eye, small and closed, with short segments, and set
in a narrow and angular basin. Stalk, short, inserted in a wide and
deep cavity, which, with the base, is entirely covered with rough brown
russet. Flesh, yellowish, tender, and juicy, with a pleasant sub-acid
flavor.

A valuable and now well-known culinary apple, in use from October
to February. When well grown the Beauty of Kent is perhaps the most
magnificent apple in cultivation. Its great size, the beauty of its
coloring, the tenderness of the flesh, and profusion of delicate
sub-acid juice, constitute it one of our most popular winter apples,
for culinary purposes, and one of the most desirable and useful, either
for a small garden, or for more extended cultivation.

The tree is a strong and vigorous grower, attains a large size, and is
a good bearer; but I have always found it subject to canker when grown
on the paradise stock, and in soils which are moist and heavy.

I have not been able to ascertain the time when, or the place where
this variety originated. It is first noticed by Forsyth in his Treatise
on Fruit Trees, but is not enumerated in any of the nurserymen’s
catalogues, either of the last, or the early part of the present,
century. It was introduced to the Brompton Park Nursery, about the
year 1820, and is now as extensively cultivated as most other leading
varieties. In America, Downing says, “the fruit in this climate is one
of the most magnificent of all apples, frequently measuring sixteen or
eighteen inches in circumference.”

prominent angles on the sides, which extend to the apex, and form
ridges round the eye. Skin, dark green at first, and changing, as it
attains maturity, to pale greenish yellow on the shaded side; but
tinged with orange on the side next the sun, and strewed with a few
fawn-colored dots. Eye, open, set in a deep, narrow, and angular basin.
Stalk, short, inserted in a deep cavity. Flesh, yellowish, tender,
pleasantly sub-acid, and with a somewhat sugary flavor.

An excellent culinary apple of first-rate quality, in use from November
to March.

Fruit, above medium size, three inches wide, and three and a quarter
high; ovato-conical. Skin, thick, pale greenish yellow, and marked with
a few redish streaks on the side next the sun. Eye, small and closed.
Stalk, half-an-inch long, obliquely inserted under a fleshy lip. Flesh,
firm, juicy, and well-flavored.

A valuable culinary apple, in use from October to January. The tree is
very hardy, a strong, vigorous, and healthy grower, and a good bearer.

This is a very old English variety. It was known to Parkinson so early
as 1629, and also to Worlidge and Ray. But it is not noticed by any
subsequent author, or enumerated in any of the nursery catalogues
of the last century, until discovered by George Lindley, growing
in a garden at Gatton, near Norwich, and published by him in the
Transactions of the London Horticultural Society, vol. iv., p. 58. He
seems to be uncertain whether it is the Summer, or Winter Belle Bonne
of these early authors, but Worlidge’s description leaves no doubt as
to its identity. He says “The Summer Belle et Bonne is a good bearer,
but the fruit is not long lasting. The Winter Belle and Bon is much
to be preferred to the Summer in every respect.” I have no doubt,
therefore, that the latter is the Belle Bonne of Lindley. Parkinson
says “they are both fair fruit to look on, being yellow, and of a meane
(medium) bignesse.”

 FIGURE.--Ron. Pyr. Mal. pl. xvi., f. 4.

Fruit, below medium size, two inches and a half wide, and two inches
high; roundish, narrowing a little towards the apex, regularly and
handsomely formed. Skin, pale green, changing to yellow as it ripens,
with a tinge of brown where exposed to the sun, and strewed with
grey, russety dots. Eye, small, partially closed with short segments,
and placed in a round, narrow, and rather shallow basin. Stalk,
half-an-inch long, inserted in a round and deep cavity. Flesh, greenish
yellow, tender, soft, brisk, sugary, and aromatic.

An excellent, but not first-rate apple, suitable either for the dessert
or culinary purposes. It is in use from November to March.


25. BELLE GRIDELINE.--Lind.

 IDENTIFICATION.--Lind. Plan Or. 1796. Lind. Guide, 36.

 SYNONYME.--Belle Grisdeline, _Fors. Treat._ 93.

Fruit, medium sized; round, and regularly formed. Skin, clear yellow,
marbled and washed with clear red, and intermixed with thin grey russet
next the sun. Eye, set in a deep, round basin. Stalk, slender, deeply
inserted in a round cavity. Flesh, white, firm, crisp, and briskly
flavored.

An excellent dessert apple, in season from December to March. The tree
is healthy and vigorous, of the middle size, and an excellent bearer.

This beautiful variety was first brought into notice by Mr. George
Lindley, who found it growing in a small garden near Surrey Street
Gates, Norwich, where it had originated about the year 1770. Mr.
Lindley first propagated it in 1793, and the original tree died about
seven years afterwards.


26. BENNET APPLE.--Knight.

 IDENTIFICATION AND FIGURE.--Pom. Heref. t. 21. Lind Guide, 101.

Fruit, somewhat long, irregularly shaped, broad at the base, and narrow
at the apex, but sometimes broader at the middle than either of the
extremities. A few obtuse angles terminate at the eye, which is small
and nearly closed, with very short segments. Stalk, half-an-inch long,
and very slender. Skin, dingy colored russety grey in the shade; and
shaded on the sunny side with numerous streaks and patches of orange
color and muddy red.

The specific gravity of the juice is 1073.

This is a good cider apple, and produces liquor of great excellence
when mixed with other varieties. It is chiefly grown in the deep
strong soils of the south-west part of Herefordshire, and is common in
the district known as the Golden Vale. Knight says it was a very old
variety, and was known previous to the 17th century, but I have not
been able to find any record of it in the early works on Pomology.


27. BENWELL’S PEARMAIN.--Hort.

 IDENTIFICATION.--Hort Soc. Cat. ed. 3, n. 534. Lind. Guide, 64.

Fruit, medium sized; pearmain-shaped. Skin, dull green with broken
stripes of dull red, on the side next the sun. Eye, small, set in a
shallow and slightly plaited basin. Stalk, deeply inserted in a round
cavity, scarcely protruding beyond the base. Flesh, yellowish white,
crisp, juicy, brisk, and aromatic.

A dessert apple, in use from December to January.

It received its name from a gentleman of the name of Benwell, of
Henley-on-Thames, from whom it was received, and brought into
cultivation by Kirke, a nurseryman at Brompton.

and changing to yellow as it ripens, with stripes of red next the sun.
Eye, open, placed in a wide and shallow basin. Stalk, inserted in a
deep cavity. Flesh, crisp, juicy, and briskly acid.

An excellent culinary apple, in use during September and October.

This variety was raised by the Rev. S. Breedon, D.D., of Bere Court,

Fruit, above medium size, two inches and three quarters wide, and
nearly three inches high; conical, and handsomely shaped. Skin, yellow,
with a few markings of red on the shaded side; but where exposed to
the sun it is almost entirely washed and striped with fine clear red.
Eye, small, and partially open, set in a rather deep and plaited basin,
which is surrounded with five prominent knobs or ridges. Stalk, short
and thick, inserted in a rather shallow cavity, with generally a fleshy
protuberance on one side of it, and surrounded with yellowish brown
russet, which extends over a considerable portion of the base. Flesh,
white, tender, and juicy, with a fine, sugary, and vinous flavor.

An excellent apple either for culinary or dessert use. It is in season
from November to March.

The tree is hardy, a vigorous grower, and an abundant bearer. The
flowers are very late in expanding, and are, therefore, not liable to
be injured by spring frosts.

at first, and considerably covered with ashy grey russet; but changing
to pale yellow, and with a brownish tinge on the side next the sun.
Eye, open, with short reflexed segments, and set in a very shallow
depression. Stalk, short, about a quarter of an inch long, with a
fleshy protuberance on one side of it, and inserted in a shallow and
narrow cavity. Flesh, greenish yellow, tender, juicy, rich, and sugary.

A dessert apple of first-rate quality, in use from November to January.

striped with bright crimson next the sun. Eye, open, with long reflexed
segments, set in a wide and deep basin. Stalk, short, and deeply
inserted. Flesh, yellowish, tender, and juicy.

An excellent culinary apple, in use from October to December. It is
fit for use immediately it is gathered off the tree, and has a strong
resemblance to the old Nonesuch, but keeps much longer.

The tree is hardy and an excellent bearer; attains to the medium size,
and is less liable to the attacks of the Woolly Aphis than the old
Nonesuch.

This variety was raised by Mr. Arthur Biggs, the intelligent and
scientific gardener to Isaac Swainson, Esq., of Twickenham, Middlesex.

 SYNONYMES.--Grumas’s Pippin, _Fors. Treat._ 105. Brummage Pippin, and
 Grummage Pippin, _Acc. Hort. Soc. Cat._ Stone Pippin _of the Nursery
 Catalogues_.

Fruit, small, two inches and a quarter wide, and an inch and three
quarters high; round, and slightly flattened. Skin, pale dingy yellow,
mottled and veined with very thin grey russet, and russety round the
base. Eye, small, quite open, frequently without any segments, and
placed in a very slight depression. Stalk, short, scarcely at all
depressed. Flesh, greenish, very firm, crisp, and juicy, briskly and
pleasantly flavored.

A very good dessert apple; in use from January to June.

It is remarkable for the firmness and density of its flesh, and Mr.
Lindley says, its specific gravity is greater than that of any other
apple with which he was acquainted.

The tree is of diminutive size, with short but very stout shoots. It is
a good bearer.

This variety is supposed to be a native of Warwickshire. It is what is
generally known in the nurseries, under the name of Stone Pippin, but
the Gogar Pippin is also known by that name.


34. BLAND’S JUBILEE.--H.

 SYNONYMES.--Jubilee Pippin, _Hort. Trans._ vol. v., 400. Bland’s
 Jubilee Rose Pip, _Nursery Catalogues_.

Fruit, large, three inches and a quarter wide, and two inches and
three quarters high; round, narrowing a little towards the eye, and
obscurely ribbed. Skin, dull yellow tinged with green, but changing
to clear yellow as it ripens; marked with russet in the basin of the
eye, and strewed over its surface with large russety dots. Eye, small
and closed, with long acuminate segments, set in a narrow, deep, and
even basin. Stalk, short, inserted in a moderately deep cavity. Flesh,
yellowish, tender, crisp, juicy, sugary, and perfumed.

An excellent apple, either for culinary purposes, or the dessert. It is
in use from October to January.

This was raised by Michael Bland, Esq., of Norwich. The seed was sown,
on the day of the jubilee which celebrated the 50th year of the reign
of George III., in 1809, and the tree first produced fruit in 1818. It
is not a variety which is met with in general cultivation, but deserves
to be more extensively known.

[Illustration]

Fruit, large, the average size smaller than represented in the
accompanying figure, being generally three inches wide, and two and a
half high; globular, and somewhat flattened, broader at the base than
the apex, regularly and handsomely shaped. Skin, yellow, with a tinge
of dull red next the sun, and streaked with deeper red. Eye, large and
open, with short stunted segments, placed in a round and rather deep
basin. Stalk, short and stout, rather deeply inserted, and scarcely
extending beyond the base. Flesh, yellow, crisp, juicy, sweet, and
pleasantly acid.

A very valuable and highly esteemed apple, either for the dessert
or culinary purposes, but, strictly speaking, more suitable for the
latter. It is in use from November to February.

The common complaint against the Blenheim Pippin is, that the tree is
a bad bearer. This is undoubtedly the case when it is young, being
of a strong and vigorous habit of growth, and forming a large and
very beautiful standard; but when it becomes a little aged, it bears
regular and abundant crops. It may be made to produce much earlier, if
grafted on the paradise stock, and grown either as an open dwarf, or an
espalier.

This valuable apple was first discovered at Woodstock, in Oxfordshire,
and received its name from Blenheim, the seat of the Duke of
Marlborough, which is in the immediate neighbourhood. It is not noticed
in any of the nursery catalogues of the last century, nor was it
cultivated in the London nurseries till about the year 1818.

The following interesting account of this favorite variety was recently
communicated to the Gardener’s Chronicle. “In a somewhat delapidated
corner of the decaying borough of ancient Woodstock, within ten yards
of the wall of Blenheim Park, stands all that remains of the original
stump of that beautiful and justly celebrated apple, the Blenheim
Orange. It is now entirely dead, and rapidly falling to decay, being a
mere shell about ten feet high, loose in the ground, and having a large
hole in the centre; till within the last three years, it occasionally
sent up long, thin, wiry twigs, but this last sign of vitality has
ceased, and what remains will soon be the portion of the woodlouse and
the worm. Old Grimmett, the basket-maker, against the corner of whose
garden-wall the venerable relict is supported, has sat looking on it
from his workshop window, and while he wove the pliant osier, has
meditated, for more than fifty successive summers, on the mutability of
all sublunary substances, on juice, and core, and vegetable, as well
as animal, and flesh, and blood. He can remember the time when, fifty
years ago, he was a boy, and the tree a fine, full-bearing stem, full
of bud, and blossom, and fruit, and thousands thronged from all parts
to gaze on its ruddy, ripening, orange burden; then gardeners came in
the spring-tide to select the much coveted scions, and to hear the tale
of his horticultural child and sapling, from the lips of the son of the
white-haired Kempster. But nearly a century has elapsed since Kempster
fell, like a ripened fruit, and was gathered to his fathers. He lived
in a narrow cottage garden in Old Woodstock, a plain, practical,
laboring man; and in the midst of his bees and flowers around him, and
in his “glorious pride,” in the midst of his little garden, he realized
Virgil’s dream of the old Corycian:--“Et regum equabat opes animis.”

The provincial name for this apple is still “_Kempster’s Pippin_,” a
lasting monumental tribute, and inscription, to him who first planted
the kernel from whence it sprang.”

[Illustration]

Fruit, below medium size; roundish oblate, rather narrower at the apex
than the base, handsomely and regularly formed, without ribs or other
inequalities. Skin, shining, pale waxen yellow in the shade, and bright
deep red next the sun; it is strewed with dots, which are yellowish on
the sunny side, and brownish in the shade, and marked with veins and
slight traces of delicate, yellowish-grey russet. Eye, large and open,
with long reflexed segments, placed in a rather deep, round, and pretty
even basin. Stalk, short and slender, inserted in a narrow, even, and
shallow cavity, which is lined with thin russet. Flesh, white with a
yellowish tinge, crisp and delicate, brisk, juicy, and sugary, and with
a rich, vinous, and aromatic flavor.

A dessert apple of the first quality, in use from November to January.

The tree is a free grower and very hardy, not subject to canker, and
attains the largest size. It is very prolific when it has acquired
its full growth, which, in good soil, it will do in fifteen or twenty
years; and even in a young state it is a good bearer. If grafted on the
paradise stock it may be grown as an open dwarf, or an espalier. The
bloom is very hardy, and withstands the night frosts of spring better
than most other varieties.

This, above all other apples, is the most highly esteemed in Germany.
Diel calls it the Pride of the Germans. It is believed to have
originated either at a village of Misnia, called Borsdorf, or at a
place of the same name near Leipsic. According to Forsyth, it was such
a favorite with Queen Charlotte, that she had a considerable quantity
of them annually imported from Germany, for her own private use. It
is one of the earliest recorded varieties of the continental authors,
but does not seem to have been known in this country before the close
of the last century. It was first grown in the Brompton Park Nursery
in 1785. It is mentioned by Cordus, in 1561, as being cultivated in
Misnia; which circumstance has no doubt given rise to the synonyme
“Reinette de Misnie;” he also informs us it is highly esteemed for its
sweet and generous flavor, and the pleasant perfume which it exhales.
Wittichius, in his “Methodus Simplicium,” attributes to it the power of
dispelling epidemic fevers and madness!

Fruit, large and conical; handsomely and regularly formed. Skin, pale
greenish yellow, considerably covered with russet, and occasionally
marked with bright red next the sun. Eye, set in a shallow and plaited
basin. Stalk, an inch long, inserted in a rather deep cavity. Flesh,
yellowish white, tender, crisp, juicy, and sugary, and with a pleasant
sub-acid flavor.

An excellent culinary apple, though not of the first quality, in use
during December and January. The flesh is said to assume a fine color

Fruit, medium sized, three inches and a quarter wide, and two inches
and a half high; roundish, somewhat flattened, narrowing towards the
apex, and slightly angular. Skin, covered entirely with brownish
yellow russet intermixed with green, and sometimes with a faint tinge
of redish brown next the sun. Eye, closed, set in a round and rather
shallow basin. Stalk, long, slender, and inserted in a moderately deep
cavity. Flesh, yellowish white, juicy, sugary, briskly, and richly
flavored.

A very valuable dessert apple, of the first quality, in season from
January to April, and will even keep till June. It partakes much of the
flavor of the Ribston Pippin, and, as a late winter dessert apple, is
not to be surpassed.

The tree is not large, but healthy, very hardy, and an immense bearer,
and, when grafted on the paradise stock, is well suited for being grown
either as a dwarf, or an espalier.

This is an old American variety, and one of the few introduced to this
country which attains perfection in our climate. It is extensively
grown in the neighbourhood of Boston, U.S., both for home consumption
and exportation, and realizes a considerable, and profitable return to
the growers.

the surface, with patches of brown russet. Eye, set in a deep, round,
and even basin. Stalk, half an inch long, inserted in a round and
rather shallow cavity. Flesh, yellowish, rich, sugary, and aromatic.

One of the best winter dessert apples, in use from November to April,
and by many considered more sweet, and tender, than the old Nonpareil.

The tree is quite hardy, a slender grower, and never attains to a
large size, but is a very excellent bearer. It succeeds well on the
paradise stock, and is well adapted for dwarfs, or for being grown as
an espalier.

This excellent variety was raised by John Braddick, Esq., of Thames

open, with short ovate reflexed segments, which are frequently four in
number, set in a broad, shallow, and plaited basin. Stalk, half an inch
to three quarters long, inserted in a round and shallow cavity. Flesh,
yellowish, firm, and with a rich, vinous, and brisk flavor, resembling
that of a pine-apple.

This is one of the best dessert apples; it is in use during October
and November. It bears some resemblance to the Court of Wick, but is
considerably richer in flavor than that variety.

The tree is hardy; a slender grower, and does not attain a large size;
it is, however, an excellent bearer. It is well adapted for dwarf
training, and succeeds well on the paradise stock.

This esteemed variety was raised by the Rev. Dr. Symonds Breedon, at
Bere Court, near Pangbourne, Berkshire.

which extend to the eye and form ridges round the apex--the true
character of the Calvilles. Skin, tender and delicate; when ripe, of a
very pale straw color, and without the least tinge of red on the side
exposed to the sun, but sometimes marked with a few traces of delicate
russet, but no dots. Eye, large, and closed with long, broad, acuminate
segments, and set in a pretty deep and very angular basin. Stalk, three
quarters of an inch long, stout, inserted in a wide and rather shallow
cavity, which is lined with thin russet. Flesh, white, tender, and
delicate, with a sweet and pleasant flavor.

A very good early culinary apple, but not of the finest quality, being
too soft and tender; it is ripe during August, and lasts till the
middle of September.

The tree is a very strong and vigorous grower, with a large round head,
and is an excellent bearer. It is distinguished by its very large
foliage, the leaves being 4½ inches long by 3¼ broad.

This is an old continental variety, but has been very little noticed
by writers on Pomology. It is mentioned in the Jardinier Français, of
1653, and by De Quintinye, but the first work in which it is either

 Fruit, ed. 2, pl. 103.

Fruit, large, three inches and a half wide, and three inches and a
quarter high; roundish and flattened, with broad uneven and unequal
ribs, extending the whole length of the fruit, and terminating at the
apex in prominent unequal ridges. Skin, delicate pale yellow tinged
with green, becoming bright golden yellow at maturity, washed with deep
red on the side next the sun, and strewed with brown dots, and a few
markings of greyish white russet. Eye, small and closed with stout and
pointed segments, set in a deep, irregular, five-ribbed basin, which is
surrounded with knobs. Stalk, three quarters of an inch long, slender,
and inserted the whole of its length in a deep and angular cavity,
which is lined with russet. Flesh, yellowish white, delicate, and
juicy, with a rich, lively, and agreeable aromatic flavor.

A valuable winter apple, admirably adapted for all culinary purposes,
and excellent also for the dessert. It is in use from January to April.

The tree is a strong and vigorous grower, and a good bearer, but does
not attain more than the middle size. It is rather liable to canker in
damp situations, and is better suited for a dwarf than a standard; if
grown on the paradise stock the appearance of the fruit is very much
improved.

This variety is sometimes called _Pomme Glace_, which is, however, a
distinct variety, known by the names of _Rouge des Chartreux_, and
_Pomme de Concombre_; it is a variety of Calville Blanche d’Hiver, the
fruit is about the size of an egg, but twice as long.

 FIGURE.--Poit et Turp, pl. 41.

Fruit, very large, elongated, and prominently ribbed like the Calville
Blanche d’Hiver, but not so much flattened as that variety. Skin, a
little yellow on the shaded side, and of a beautiful deep red next the
sun, which is marked with stripes of darker red, strewed all over with
minute dots. Eye, small, set in a broad, deep, and angular basin, which
is surrounded with prominent knobs. Stalk, slender, deeply inserted in
an angular cavity. Flesh, white, delicate, very juicy, and charged with
an agreeable acid.

A culinary apple of the first quality; in use from January to April,
and “keeps well.” According to the Chartreux Catalogue, “est bonne
cuite pour les malades.”

The tree is a very vigorous grower, much more so than the generality of
the Calvilles; it is very hardy and an abundant bearer, and is better
adapted for being cultivated as a dwarf than an espalier; but it does
not succeed well on the paradise stock.

According to the French pomologists, this variety seems to have some
connection with this country, but there is no evidence that it was at
any period grown to any extent in England, or that it was ever known
to any of our early pomologists. It is said by some that the name
_malingre_ is applied to this variety from the fruit becoming meally
or unsound, but from the observation in the Chartreux Catalogue, it is
more probable that it is so called from being useful to invalids.

Fruit, large, three inches and a half wide, and three and a quarter
high; not so much flattened as the other Calvilles. Skin, pale red,
with a trace of yellow on the shaded side, but of a beautiful deep
crimson next the sun, and marked with yellowish dots on the shaded
side. Eye, half open, set in a rather shallow, and ribbed basin, which
is lined with fine down. Stalk, rather short, inserted in a wide and
deep cavity, which is lined with russet. Flesh, white, tinged with red
under the skin, and very much so on the side which is exposed to the
sun; it is tender, delicate, and juicy, with a pleasant, vinous, and
violet scented flavor.

A culinary apple of inferior quality in this country, but highly
esteemed on the Continent, both as a culinary and a dessert fruit. It
is in season during October and November.

The tree is a strong and vigorous grower, and attains the largest size.
It is also an abundant bearer. To have the fruit in perfection it ought
to be grown on the paradise stock as an open dwarf, in a fine sandy
loam, and not too closely pruned.

Fruit, medium sized, two inches and a half wide, and about the same
high; roundish, narrowing towards the apex, and with prominent ribs on
the sides like the other Calvilles. Skin, yellowish white, streaked and
veined with red on the shaded side; but covered with beautiful deep
shining crimson, on the side next the sun, and strewed with numerous
white dots. Eye, small and prominent, set in a narrow and wrinkled
basin. Stalk, from an inch to an inch and a half long, inserted in a
deep and narrow cavity, which is lined with thin russet. Flesh, white
tinged with red, crisp and tender, agreeably and pleasantly flavored.

A culinary apple of second-rate quality, ripe during July and August.
The flesh is stained with red, particularly on the side next the sun,
and partakes somewhat of the flavor of the strawberry. It is valued
only for its earliness.

The tree is of small habit of growth, but an excellent bearer. There
is great confusion subsisting between this variety and the Passe-pomme
Rouge, which Duhamel has described under the name of Calville d’Eté.

Fruit, large, about three inches high, and the same in width; oblong,
but not nearly so much ribbed on the sides as the other Calvilles
already described. Skin, covered with a bluish bloom, deep shining
crimson on the side next the sun, but paler red on the shaded side, and
strewed with numerous yellowish dots. Eye, large and closed, with long
segments set in a deep warted and wrinkled basin. Stalk, slender, three
quarters of an inch long, inserted in a deep cavity, which is lined
with thin brown russet. Flesh, greenish white stained with red, not
very juicy, tender, vinous, and with a pleasant perfumed flavor.

A culinary apple of second-rate quality, ripe during November and
December. The tree attains about the middle size, is vigorous and
healthy in its young state, and is a good bearer. It is well adapted
for growing as dwarfs on the paradise stock, and requires a rich and
warm soil.


61. CALVILLE ROUGE DE MICOUD.--Hort.

 IDENTIFICATION.--Hort. Trans. vol. v., p. 242. Hort. Soc. Cat. ed. 3,
 n. 119.

Fruit, below medium size; oblate, and ribbed on the sides. Skin, tough,
and bitter tasted, red all over; but of a deeper and darker color on
the side next the sun, and streaked and spotted with paler red on
the shaded side. Eye open, placed in a wide and deep basin. Stalk,
long, inserted in a round cavity. Flesh, yellowish white, tender and
delicate, crisp, sweet, and perfumed.

This curious apple has the extraordinary property of producing three
crops of fruit in one season. The first flowers appear at the usual
time in April, the second in June, and then for a time it ceases to
produce any more till the month of August, when it again blooms during
the whole of that month, September, October, and November, until it is
checked by the severity of the frosts. The first fruit is generally
ripe during August; the second in October, which are about the size of
a pigeon’s egg, and quite as good as the first. And so on it continues
until retarded by the frosts; but those last produced are rarely fit
for use.

This variety was first brought into notice by M. Thouin, of Paris, who
says the tree originated on the farm of the Baroness de Micoud, near La
Charité sur Loire, in the department of Nièvre.


62. CARLISLE CODLIN.--Hort.

 IDENTIFICATION.--Hort. Soc. Cat. ed. 3, n. 154.

 FIGURE.--Ron. Pyr. Mal. pl. iii. f. 2.

Fruit, above medium size; ovate flat at the base, irregular and angular
on the sides. Skin, smooth and unctuous, pale yellow and strewed with
a few russety specks. Eye, closed, set in a narrow, rather deep, and
plaited basin. Stalk, very short, embedded in the cavity, which is
lined with russet, a few lines of which extend over the base. Flesh,
white, tender, crisp, and juicy, with a fine, brisk, and sugary flavor.

A culinary apple of the first quality, in use from August to December.
It is one of the most useful as well as one of the best culinary apples
we have, being fit for use when no larger than a walnut, and after
perfecting their growth continuing in perfection as late as Christmas.
If blanched in warm water, when used small, the outer rind slips off,
and they may be baked whole; their color is then a transparent green;
and their flavor is exquisite, resembling that of a green apricot.
When it is about the size of a large nutmeg, it may be made into apple
marmalade, or a dried sweetmeat, which rivals the finest Portugal
plum.--_M.C.H.S._

The tree is very hardy, a free grower, and an abundant bearer. As it
does not attain a great size, it may be grown more closely together
than most other sorts. It is a dwarf variety of the old English Codlin.


63. CAROLINE.--Lind.

 IDENTIFICATION.--Lind. Guide, 41. Hort. Trans. vol. iv., p. 66. Hort.

with broad patches of red. Eye, small, set in a narrow and plaited
basin. Stalk, short, inserted in a shallow cavity, which is lined with
russet. Flesh, firm, brisk, juicy, and highly flavored.

A culinary apple of first-rate quality, in use from November to
February.

This variety was named in honor of Lady Caroline Suffield, the wife of
Lord Suffield, of Blickling and Gunton Hall, Norfolk.--_Lindley._

 IDENTIFICATION.--Raii Hist. ii. 1447, n. 8. Lind. Guide, 65. Down. Fr.
 Amer. 103. Hort. Soc. Cat. ed. 3, n. 130.

 SYNONYME.--Cat’s Head, _Fors. Treat._ 97.

Fruit, large, three inches and a quarter broad, and the same in height;
oblong, nearly as broad at the apex as at the base, with prominent ribs
on the sides, which extend into the basin of the eye, and terminate
in several knobs. Skin, smooth and unctuous, pale green; but with a
brownish tinge next the sun, and strewed with minute russety dots. Eye,
large and open, set in a large, angular, and rather deep basin. Stalk,
short, and slender for the size of the fruit, inserted in a shallow and
angular cavity. Flesh, tender, juicy, and sweet, with a pleasant, acid,
and slightly perfumed flavor.

One of our oldest and best culinary apples; it is in use from October
to January.

The tree is a strong and vigorous grower, and attains the largest
size, and though not an abundant bearer during the early period of its
growth, it is much more productive as it becomes aged.

In the Horticultural Society’s Catalogue of Fruits, and also in
Lindley’s “Guide to the Orchard.” This is made synonymous with the
Costard of Ray, which is undoubtedly an error, the Costard being a
distinct variety.

The Catshead is one of our oldest varieties, and was always highly
esteemed for its great size. Phillips, in his poem on Cyder, says--

    “-------- Why should we sing the Thrift,
    Codling or Pomroy, or of pimpled coat
    The Russet, or the _Cat’s-Head’s_ weighty orb,
    Enormous in its growth, for various use
    Tho’ these are meet, tho’ after full repast,
    Are oft requir’d, and crown the rich dessert.”

In Ellis’s “Modern Husbandman,” he says the Catshead is, “a very useful
apple to the farmer, because one of them pared and wrapped up in dough,
serves with little trouble for making an apple-dumpling, so much in
request with the Kentish farmer, for being part of a ready meal,
that in the cheapest manner satiates the keen appetite of the hungry
plowman, both at home and in the field, and, therefore, has now got
into such reputation in Hertfordshire, and some other counties, that it
is become the most common food with a piece of bacon or pickle-pork for
families.”


65. CELLINI.--Hort.

 IDENTIFICATION.--Hort. Soc. Cat. ed. 3, n. 132.

[Illustration]

Fruit, rather above medium size; roundish and flattened at both ends.
Skin, rich deep yellow, with spots and patches of lively red on the
shaded side; and bright red streaked and mottled with dark crimson
next the sun, with here and there a tinge of yellow breaking through.
Eye, large and open, with short, acute, and reflexed segments, and set
in a shallow and slightly plaited basin. Stalk, very short, inserted
in a funnel-shaped cavity. Flesh, white, tender, juicy, brisk, and
pleasantly flavored.

A culinary apple of the first quality; in use during October and
November. It is a fine, showy, and handsome apple, bearing a strong
resemblance to the Nonesuch, from which in all probability it was
raised. It originated with Mr. Leonard Phillips, of Vauxhall.

Fruit, very small, about three quarters of an inch broad, and the same
in height; oblato-oblong. Skin, thin, and shining, of a beautiful lemon
color on the shaded side, but entirely covered with dark blood-red
on the side exposed to the sun, and which extends towards the shaded
side of a fine crimson. Stalk, very slender, an inch and a half long,
inserted in a small round cavity. Eye, small, without any segments, and
placed in a shallow basin. Flesh, yellow, firm, crisp, and juicy, with
a very pleasant and lively sub-acid flavor.

A beautiful little apple, more resembling a cherry in its general
appearance than an apple. It is ripe in October.

The tree, when full grown, is from fifteen to twenty feet high,
and produces an abundance of its beautiful fruit. It is perfectly
hardy, and may be grown in almost any description of soil. It forms a
beautiful object when grown as an ornamental tree on a lawn or in a
shrubbery.

and slender, not protruding beyond the margin, inserted in a deep
cavity, which is lined with russet. Flesh, yellowish white, tender,
brisk, juicy, sugary, and pleasantly flavored.

A dessert apple of the first quality; in use from December to February.

The tree is an abundant bearer, but constitutionally weak, a delicate
grower, and subject to canker and mildew. On the paradise stock it
forms a beautiful, compact, and handsome little pyramid.

It was raised by a Mr. Christie, at Kingston-on-Thames.

Fruit, medium sized; pearmain-shaped. Skin, dull yellow mixed with
green, and a thin coating of russet and numerous dots on the shaded
side; but marked with broken stripes of dark red, on the side exposed
to the sun. Eye, large and open, with long segments set in a deep
basin. Stalk, an inch long, inserted in a smooth and rather deep
cavity. Flesh, yellowish, crisp, juicy, rich, and sugary, partaking of
the flavor of the Ribston Pippin.

A valuable and highly esteemed dessert apple of the first quality; it
comes into use in November, and will continue till March.

The tree, though not a strong or vigorous grower, is hardy and healthy,
attains the middle size, and is an abundant bearer. It succeeds well
grafted on the paradise stock, and grown as an espalier or an open
dwarf. Its shoots are slender and drooping.

This excellent variety was discovered by John Braddick, Esq., growing
in a hedge near his residence at Claygate, a hamlet in the parish of
Thames Ditton, in Surry, and by him widely and freely distributed.


70. CLARA PIPPIN.--Thomp.

 IDENTIFICATION.--Thomp. in Gard. Chron. 1848, p. 300.

green at first, but changing to yellow on the shaded side; with an
orange tinge next the sun, marked all over with veins and reticulations
of pale, brownish grey russet, with large patches round the stalk and
the eye. Eye, large and open, placed in a very shallow depression.
Stalk, short, inserted in a shallow cavity. Flesh, yellowish, firm,
crisp, and tender, with a brisk, sugary, and perfumed flavor.

A very good dessert apple, but not of first-rate quality; in use from
November to March. The fruit is produced in clusters, and it not
unfrequently happens that two are found joined together.

The tree is hardy, a small grower, and a good bearer.


72. COBHAM.--Hort.

 IDENTIFICATION.--Hort. Soc. Cat. ed. 3, n. 148. Lind. Guide, 13.

Fruit, large, three inches and a quarter wide, and over two inches and
three quarters high; roundish and angular. Skin, lemon yellow tinged
with green; but with a few patches and pencilings of red next the sun,
and covered with specks and patches of russet. Eye, open, with short
segments, set in a wide and angular basin. Stalk, short and slender,
inserted in a wide, deep, and russety cavity. Flesh, yellowish, crisp,
firm, delicate, and juicy, with a brisk and sugary flavor.

An excellent culinary apple, and not unworthy of the dessert; it is
in use from November to Christmas, and partakes of the Ribston Pippin
flavor.

The tree is hardy, vigorous, and an excellent bearer.

The Cobham is so like a variety which is cultivated near Faversham, in
Kent, under the name of Pope’s apple, that there is some difficulty in
distinguishing the one from the other. Further observation may prove
them to be synonymous.--_See Pope’s Apple._

 IDENTIFICATION.--Hort. Soc. Cat. ed. 3, n. 150. Lind. Guide, 102.

 SYNONYMES.--Cockagee, _Fors. Treat._ 97. Cocko Gee.

Fruit, medium sized; ovate, and slightly angular. Skin, smooth, pale
yellow, interspersed with green specks. Eye, small and closed, set in a
deep, uneven, and irregular basin. Stalk, short, inserted in a narrow
and shallow cavity. Flesh, yellowish white, soft, sharply acid, and
austere.

One of the oldest and best cider apples. Although it is perhaps the
most harsh and austere apple known, and generally considered only fit
for cider, still it is one of the best for all culinary purposes,
especially for baking, as it possesses a particularly rich flavor when
cooked.

The name is said to be derived from _Cocko-Gee_ signifying
_Goose-dung_. In Langley’s “Pomona,” it is said, “This fruit is
originally from Ireland, and the cyder much valued in that country.
About sixteen or eighteen years since [1727] it was first brought over,
and promoted about Minehead, in Somersetshire. Some gentlemen of that
county have got enough of it now to make five, six, or eight hogsheads
a year of the cyder; and such as have to spare from their own tables,
sell, I am told, from four to eight pounds a hogshead. The cyder is
of the color of sherry (or rather of French white wine), and every
whit as fine and clear. I have tasted of it from several orchards in
Somersetshire. It hath a more vinous taste than any cyder I ever drank,
and as the sight might deceive a curious eye for wine, so I believe the
taste might pass an incurious palate for the same liquor.”

extensively grown in Surry and Sussex.


75. COE’S GOLDEN DROP.--Hort.

 IDENTIFICATION.--Hort. Soc. Cat. ed. 3, n. 274.

[Illustration]

Fruit, small, conical, even, and regularly shaped. Skin, green at
first, but changing as it ripens to yellow, with a few large crimson
spots, on the side exposed to the sun, and marked with small patches
of thin delicate russet. Eye, small and open, even with the surface,
and surrounded with a few shallow plaits. Stalk, three quarters of an
inch long, inserted in a small, and shallow depression, which, together
with the base, is entirely covered with russet. Flesh, greenish-yellow,
firm, crisp, and very juicy, brisk, sugary, and vinous.

A delicious little dessert apple of the first quality, in use from
November to May.

The tree is hardy, a free upright grower, and a good bearer. It attains
about the middle size. If grafted on the paradise stock it is well
suited for espaliers, or growing as an open dwarf.

This excellent variety was introduced to notice by Gervase Coe, of Bury
St. Edmonds, who raised the Golden Drop Plum. It has been said that it
is a very old variety, which has existed for many years in some Essex

shallow, and plaited basin. Stalk, about a quarter of an inch long,
inserted in a round, deep, and even cavity, which is lined with thin
pale brown russet. Flesh, white, slightly tinged with red under the
skin on the side next the sun, firm, crisp, and brittle, very juicy,
with a sweet, brisk, and fine strawberry flavor.

A very excellent dessert apple; ripe in the end of September and during
October, at which season it is very common in Covent Garden Market.

In some parts of Kent this excellent little apple is produced in large
quantities for the supply of the London markets, but it is one which is
not met with in general cultivation.

Fruit, large, three inches and a quarter wide, and the same in height;
ovate, angular on the sides, and ribbed round the eye, somewhat like
a Quoining. Skin, dull green on the shaded side, and brownish red
streaked with brighter red on the side next the sun; some parts of the
surface marked with thin russet. Eye, large and closed, set in a narrow
and angular basin. Stalk, three quarters of an inch long, inserted in a
rather shallow cavity. Flesh, yellowish, firm, rich, and aromatic.

This is one of our best dessert apples, remarkable for its rich and
aromatic flavor; it is in use from December to May.

The tree is hardy, and a free grower, attaining the middle size, but
not an abundant bearer; it produces its fruit at the extremities of
the last year’s wood, and great care should, therefore, be taken to
preserve the bearing shoots. It succeeds well, grafted on the paradise
stock, and grown as an espalier or an open dwarf.

This valuable apple was brought into notice by Sir Christopher Hawkins,
who sent it to the London Horticultural Society, in 1813. It was
discovered about the beginning of the present century, growing in a
cottager’s garden, near Truro, in Cornwall.

The name July-flower is very often applied to this and some other
varieties of apples, and also to flowers, but it is only a corruption
of the more correct name Gilliflower, which is derived from the French
_Girofle_, signifying a clove, and hence the flower which has the
scent of that spice, is called _Giroflier_, which has been transformed
to _Gilliflower_. In Chaucer’s “Romaunt of the Rose,” he writes it
_Gylofre_.

    “There was eke wexyng many a spice,
    As Clowe Gylofre and liquorice.”

Turner writes it _Gelower_ and _Gelyfloure_. The proper name,
therefore, is Gilliflower, and not July-flower, as if it had some
reference to the month of July.


82. COSTARD.--Ray.

 IDENTIFICATION.--Raii Hist. ii. 1447. Laws. New. Orch. 32. Worl. Vin.

 SYNONYMES.--Coulthard, _in Lancashire_. Prussian Pippin, _Ibid._

Fruit, above medium size, two inches and three quarters, or three
inches wide, and three inches and a quarter high; oblong, but narrowing
a little towards the eye, distinctly five-sided, having five prominent
ribs on the sides, which extend into the basin of the eye, and form
ridges round the crown. Skin, smooth, dull yellowish green, strewed
all over with embedded grey specks. Eye, partially closed with long
acuminate segments, and set in a rather deep and angular basin. Stalk,
about a quarter of an inch long, inserted in a round, rather shallow,
and narrow cavity. Flesh, greenish-white, tender, juicy, and with a
brisk, and pleasant sub-acid flavor.

An excellent culinary apple of first-rate quality. It is in season from
October to Christmas.

The tree is hardy, a strong and vigorous grower, with strong downy
shoots, and an abundant bearer.

The Costard is one of our oldest English apples. It is mentioned under
the name of “Poma Costard,” in the fruiterers’ bills of Edward the
First, in 1292, at which time it was sold for a shilling a hundred.
The true Costard is now rarely to be met with, but at an early period
it must have been very extensively grown, for the retailers of it
were called Costardmongers, an appellation now transformed into
Costermongers. It is mentioned by William Lawson, in 1597, who, in his
quaint style, says, “Of your apple-trees you shall finde difference
in growth. A good Pipping will grow large, and a Costard-tree: stead
them on the north side of your other apples, thus being placed, the
least will give sunne to the rest, and the greatest will shroud their
fellowes.”

Modern authors make the Costard synonymous with the Catshead, chiefly,
I think, on the authority of Mr. George Lindley, who has it so in the
“Guide to the Orchard;” but this is evidently an error. All the early
authors who mention both varieties regard them as distinct. Parkinson
describes two varieties of Costard--the “Gray,” and the “Greene.” Of
the former, he says, “it is a good great apple, somewhat whitish on
the outside, and abideth the winter. The Green Costard is like the
other, but greener on the outside continually.” Ray describes both the
Catshead and Costard as distinct, and Leonard Meager enumerates three
varieties of Costard in his list--the white, grey, and red; but which
of these is identical with that described above, it is difficult now to
determine.

Some etymologists, and Dr. Johnson among the number, consider this name
to be derived from _Cost_, a head; but what connection there is between
either the shape or other appearance of this apple, and a head, more
than any other variety, must puzzle any one to discover. Is it not
more probable that it is derived from Costatus (_Anglice_, costate, or
ribbed), on account of the prominent ribs or angles on its sides? I
think this a much more likely derivation.

Fruit, medium sized; roundish, and angular on the sides. A good deal
resembling the Hawthornden. Skin, pale yellow, marked with dull red
next the sun, and streaked and dotted with deeper red. Stalk, slender.
Flesh, yellowish, crisp, juicy, brisk, and well-flavored.

An excellent culinary apple, in use from October to February. It is
said to be of finer flavor than the Hawthornden, and to be even a good
dessert apple.

The tree is hardy, a strong, vigorous, and upright grower, and an
abundant bearer. It is well suited for all northern and exposed
situations.

This is one of the varieties raised by Sir G. S. Mackenzie, Bart., of
Coul, Rosshire.

with russety freckles. Eye, large and open, with long, acuminate, and
reflexed segments, set in a wide, shallow, and even basin. Stalk, short
and slender, inserted in a smooth and even cavity, which is lined with
thin russet. Flesh, yellow, tender, crisp, very juicy, rich, and highly
flavored.

One of the best and most valuable dessert apples, both as regards the
hardiness of the tree, and the rich and delicious flavor of the fruit,
which is not inferior to that of the Golden Pippin. It is in use from
October to March.

The tree attains the middle size, is healthy, hardy, and an abundant
bearer. There is scarcely any description of soil or exposure where
it does not succeed, nor is it subject to the attacks of blight and
canker. It grows well on the paradise stock, producing fruit much
larger than on the crab, but not of so long duration.

This variety is said to have originated at Court of Wick, in
Somersetshire, and to have been raised from a pip of the Golden Pippin.
It is first mentioned by Forsyth, but I have not been able to discover
any facts relative to its history.

Fruit, medium sized; oblate, regularly and handsomely shaped. Skin,
bright green at first on the shaded side, but changing as it ripens
to clear yellow, marked with traces of russet, and russety dots; but
entirely covered with deep crimson, which is also marked with traces
of russet on the side next the sun, extending even to some portion of
the shaded side. Eye, open, with short segments, which are reflexed at
the tips, and set in a wide, even, and deep basin. Stalk, very short,
inserted in a wide and deep cavity, lined with russet, which extends
over a portion of the base. Flesh, yellowish-white, firm, crisp, brisk,
rich, and sugary, with an abundance of vinous and perfumed juice.

A valuable dessert apple of the first quality; in use from December to
May.

The tree is of small habit of growth, but very hardy and an abundant
bearer. It is well adapted for espalier training when worked on the
paradise stock; and if grafted on the Pomme Paradis of the French, it
may be grown in pots, in which it forms a beautiful and interesting
object when laden with its beautiful fruit.

The bloom expands later than that of any other variety, and on that
account is less liable to be injured by spring frosts, hence, according
to Thompson, it has been called the _Wise Apple_.

This is not the Capendu of Duhamel, as quoted by Lindley and Downing;
neither is it the Court-pendu of Forsyth and De Quintinye, that variety
being the Fenouillet Rouge of Duhamel, _see No. 123_. The Courpendu of
Miller is also a different apple from any of those just mentioned,
and is distinguished by having a long and slender stalk, “so that
the fruit is always hanging downwards.” The name of this variety is
derived from _Corps pendu_ translated by some _Hanging Body_, whereas
that of the variety above described, is from _Court pendu_, signifying
_suspended short_, the stalk being so short, that the fruit, sits, as
it were, upon the branch. The name Capendu or Capendua, is mentioned
by the earliest authors, but applied to different varieties of apples.
It is met with in Ruellius, Tragus, Curtius, and Dalechamp, the latter
considering it the _Cestiana_ of Pliny. Curtius applies the name
to a yellow apple, and so also does Ruellius; but Tragus considers
it one of the varieties of Passe-pomme, he says, “Capendua magna
sunt alba et dulcia, in quorum utero semina per maturitatem sonant,
Ruellio _Passipoma_ apellantur.” They are also mentioned by J. Bauhin,
“Celeberrimum hoc pomi genus est totius Europæ, sic dicta, quòd ex
curto admodum pendeant pediculo.”


86. COWARNE RED.--Knight.

 IDENTIFICATION AND FIGURE.--Knight, Pom. Heref. t. 28.

Fruit, of a pretty good size, a little more long than broad, but narrow
at the crown, in which appear a few obtuse and undefined plaits. Eye,
small, with very short converging segments of the calyx. Stalk, hardly
half an inch long, very stiff and straight. Skin, a small part of it
pale gold on the shaded side, and round the base, but of a bright red
over a great part, and where fully exposed to the sun, of an intense,
deep, purplish crimson; there are numerous short streaks, which mark
the shady part of the fruit.

patches of thin and delicate brown russet, and thickly strewed with
dark russety dots. Eye, open, with broad flat segments, and set in a
narrow, shallow, and regularly plaited basin. Stalk, short, set in a
deep cavity, which is lined with russet. Flesh, yellow, tender, crisp,
juicy, sugary, and richly flavored.

An excellent dessert apple, in use during October and November, after
which it becomes dry and meally but does not shrivel.

This variety was raised from a seed of the Scarlet Nonpareil, by Mr.
Creed, gardener, at Norton Court, near Faversham, in Kent.


89. CREEPER.--H.

Fruit, rather below medium size, two inches and a quarter high, and

Fruit, rather below medium size; oblate, and sometimes a little angular
in its outline. Skin, smooth and shining, entirely covered with deep
purplish red, except where it is shaded by a leaf or twig, and then
it is of a delicate pale green, presenting a clear and well-defined
outline of the object which shades it. Eye, quite closed, with very
long tomentose segments, and placed in an undulating and shallow basin,
which is sometimes knobbed, and generally lined with thick tomentum.
Stalk, about three quarters of an inch long, fleshy at the insertion,
deeply set in a round and funnel-shaped cavity. Flesh, white tinged
with green, crisp, brisk, and very juicy, with a rich vinous, and
refreshing flavor.

A very valuable and first-rate dessert apple. It ripens on the tree the
first week in August, and lasts till the end of September. It is one of
the earliest summer dessert apples, and at that season, is particularly
relished, for its fine, cooling, and refreshing, vinous juice.

The tree attains a considerable size, it is particularly hardy, and
a most prolific bearer. It succeeds well in almost every soil and
situation, and is admirably adapted for orchard planting. In almost
every latitude of Great Britain, from Devonshire to the Moray Frith,
I have observed it in perfect health and luxuriance, producing an
abundance of well ripened fruit, which, though not so large, nor so
early in the northern parts, still possessing the same richness of
flavor as in the south.

This is supposed to be a very old variety, but there is no record
of it previous to 1693, when it is mentioned by Ray; and except by
Mortimer, it is not noticed by any subsequent writer till within a very
recent period. It seems to have been unknown to Switzer, Langley, and
Miller; nor do I find that it was grown in any of the London nurseries
before the beginning of the present century. The only early catalogue
in which I find it is that of Miller and Sweet, of Bristol, in 1790.


93. DR. HELSHAM’S PIPPIN.--Lind.

Fruit, medium sized; conical, more long than broad, eight or nine
inches in circumference, a little angular on the sides. Eye, small,
in a rather wide and oblique basin. Stalk, half an inch long, deeply
inserted. Skin, yellowish-green, with several redish spots; on the
sunny side of a fine clear red. Flesh, white. Juice sweet, with a
slight aromatic flavor.

Ripe in August and beginning of September.

The branches of this tree droop in the manner of a Jargonelle Pear. It
is an abundant bearer and deserves cultivation.

The original tree which is a large one, was raised by the late Dr.
Helsham, and is now growing in the garden of Mr. Etheredge, of Stoke
Ferry, in Norfolk.--_Lindley._

I have never met with this variety, but as Mr. Lindley recommends it

large and quite open, with long, flat, acuminate segments, set in a
wide, flat, and shallow basin. Stalk, slender, half-an-inch long, and
inserted in a shallow cavity which is lined with delicate russet.
Flesh, yellowish white, delicate, firm, crisp, and juicy, with a rich,
brisk, vinous and somewhat aromatic flavor.

A dessert apple of first-rate quality, resembling the Golden Pippin
both in size, shape, and color, as well as flavor. It is in use from
November to January.

The tree is a strong, healthy, and vigorous grower, a most abundant
bearer, and attains about the middle size. It may be grown as an open
dwarf, and is well suited for espaliers. The fruit is also valuable for
the cider it produces, the specific gravity of the juice being 1080.

This excellent variety was raised by Thomas Andrew Knight, Esq., of

side; but of a clearer, and deeper yellow on the side next the sun,
the whole marked with patches of delicate, dark brown russet, and
strewed with numerous russety dots; sometimes there is a faint tinge
of red on the side next the sun. Eye, small and closed, with acuminate
segments, which are covered with white tomentum, and set in a wide,
deep, irregular and plaited basin. Stalk, very short, and somewhat
fleshy, inserted in a wide, rather shallow, and smooth cavity. Flesh,
yellowish-white, tender, crisp, and juicy, with a brisk, vinous, and
sugary flavor.

A pretty good apple of second-rate quality, more suitable for culinary
purposes than the dessert. It is in use from October to Christmas.

The tree is a healthy and free grower, attaining about the middle size,
and is a free and early bearer, being generally well set with fruit
buds. It requires a rich soil and warm situation.

There is another apple totally different from this to which the name of
Drap d’Or is applied.--See _Fenouillet Jaune_.


97. DREDGE’S FAIR MAID OF WISHFORD.--Fors.

 IDENTIFICATION.--Fors. Treat. 99. Rog. Fr. Cult. 55.

Fruit, medium sized, two inches and three quarters wide, and two inches
and a quarter high; oblato-cylindrical, with obtuse angles on the
sides. Skin, yellow, covered with large patches and reticulations of
thin brown russet, which is strewed with rougher russety freckles, and
tinged with orange and a few streaks of red next the sun. Eye, rather
large, with long acuminate segments, which almost close it; and set in
a wide, angular, and pretty deep basin. Stalk, short, inserted in a
narrow, angular and smooth cavity, which is tinged with green. Flesh,
yellowish, firm, brisk, juicy, sugary, and richly flavored.

An excellent apple for culinary purposes, and even worthy of the
dessert. It is in use from December to March.

This, with the following variety, was either raised or first brought
into notice, by a Mr. William Dredge, of Wishford, near Salisbury. In
a letter dated November, 1802, which is in my possession, he writes to
the late Mr. Forsyth with specimens of these varieties, and of this he
says, “not in eating till Easter, great bearer, most excellent flavor.”

The tree is a free grower, attaining about the middle size, and is an
excellent bearer.


98. DREDGE’S FAME.--Fors.

 IDENTIFICATION.--Fors. Treat. 100. Rog. Fr. Cult. 51.

[Illustration]

Fruit, above medium size; roundish, inclining to ovate, and furrowed
round the eye. Skin, dull dingy yellow, with a tinge of green, covered
with patches of thin russet, and large russety dots, particularly
over the base; and mottled with pale red on the side exposed to the
sun. Eye, closed, set in a deep and angular basin. Stalk, about three
quarters of an inch long, inserted in a deep cavity which is lined with
russet. Flesh, greenish-yellow, firm, crisp, juicy, brisk, and sugary,
with a rich aromatic flavor.

This is a valuable and very excellent apple, suitable either for
dessert use, or culinary purposes. It is in use from December to March.
In his letter to Mr. Forsyth, referred to above, Mr. Dredge says, “This
is the best apple yet known; in eating from Easter till Midsummer--most
excellent.”

The tree is hardy, a vigorous grower, an early and abundant bearer, but
according to Rogers, liable to be attacked by the woolly aphis; still
I have never found it more susceptible of that disease than most other
varieties.

There are several other varieties mentioned by Forsyth as _seedlings_
of Dredge’s, which I have not met with, as Dredge’s Queen Charlotte,
Dredge’s Russet, and Dredge’s Seedling. I have also in my collection,
Dredge’s Emperor and Lord Nelson, both of which are grown in the
West of England, but I have not yet had an opportunity of seeing the
fruit. It is, however, a question whether these are really seedlings
of Dredge’s or not; there are several varieties to which he affixed
his name, which have been ascertained to be identical with others that
existed before him, such as Dredge’s White Lily, which is synonymous
with Devonshire Buckland, and Dredge’s Beauty of Wilts, which is the
same as Harvey’s Pippin. Such instances tend to weaken our faith in the
high encomium passed upon him, by Rogers, of Southampton, in the “Fruit
Cultivator,” and induce us to class him with those who not only change
the name of some varieties, and append their own to others under the
pretence of their being new, and seedlings of their own, but dispose
of them at greater prices than they could have procured, had they
been sold under their correct names. We have but to glance over the
Horticultural Society’s Catalogue, or the Index to this work, to find
numerous instances confirmatory of this statement.

Fruit, large; roundish and flattened. Skin, pale yellow, strewed
with minute russety dots, and greenish embedded specks under the
surface and with a tinge of pale red on the side next the sun, which
is sometimes almost entirely covered with a bright red cheek. Eye,
large and open, with broad, reflexed, acuminate segments, set in an
irregular, uneven, and pretty deep basin. Stalk, half-an-inch long,
deeply inserted in a narrow, and funnel-shaped cavity, which is lined
with russet. Flesh, yellowish-white, firm, crisp, brisk, and very
juicy, with a slight aromatic flavor.

One of the most valuable culinary apples; it is in use from November to
March.

The tree is one of the strongest, and most vigorous growers, very
hardy, and an excellent bearer. The young shoots which are long and
stout, are thickly covered with large greyish white dots, which readily
distinguish this variety from almost every other.

This excellent apple was raised by a person of the name of Dumeller,
(pronounced _Dumelow_), a farmer at Shakerstone, a village in
Leicestershire, six miles from Ashby-de-la-Zouch, and is extensively
cultivated in that, and the adjoining counties under the names of
Dumelow’s Crab. It was first introduced to the neighbourhood of London,
by Mr. Richard Williams, of the Turnham Green Nursery, who received it
from Gopsal Hall, the seat of Earl Howe, and presented specimens of the
fruit to the Horticultural Society in 1820. It was with him that the
name of Wellington Apple originated, and by which only it is now known
in the London markets.


102. DUNCAN.--Hort.

 IDENTIFICATION.--Hort. Soc. Cat. ed. 3, p. 14?

Fruit, medium sized, two inches and three quarters broad, and two
inches and a half high; conical, with ribs on the sides which terminate
in irregular and unequal knobs round the eye. Skin, pale yellow in the
shade; but deep orange finely veined with rich deep crimson next the
sun. Eye, partially closed with short, broad segments, and set in a
deep, irregular, and prominently angular basin. Stalk, very short, set
in a round cavity. Flesh, yellowish-white, crisp, juicy, and pleasantly
acid.

A handsome, showy, and very good culinary apple; in use from November
to January.

Fruit, medium sized; roundish, even and handsomely shaped, narrowing a
little towards the apex, where it is sometimes slightly ribbed. Skin,
dull greenish-yellow, marked all over with broken streaks of pale red
and crimson, with traces of russet, and numerous russety dots, which
are thickest round the eye. Eye, small and closed, with short and
pointed segments, placed in a deep and narrow basin. Stalk, an inch
long, inserted in a round and deep cavity, which, with a portion of
the base, is lined with rough russet. Flesh, yellow, firm, crisp, very
juicy, rich, sugary, and aromatic.

A very valuable and delicious dessert apple; in use from December to
April.

The tree is hardy, a vigorous grower, and a very abundant bearer.
It attains about the middle size when fully grown. The shoots are
thickly set with fruit spurs. It is well adapted for dwarf or espalier
training, and for these purposes succeeds well on the paradise stock.

Fruit, of medium size, two inches and three quarters wide, and two
inches and a quarter high; round. Skin, smooth, pale yellowish-green
at first, but changing to clear pale yellow as it ripens, and set with
embedded white specks, particularly round the eye. Eye, small and
closed, set in a round and shallow basin. Stalk, half an inch long,
inserted in a rather shallow cavity. Flesh, white, tender, crisp, and
juicy, with a quick and pleasantly sub-acid flavor, and as is justly
remarked by Mr. Thompson, “closely approximates that of the Newtown
Pippin, of perfect American growth.”

An estimable and refreshing early dessert apple, of the first quality;
ripe in the end of July and the beginning of August.

The tree is a healthy, and free, though not a vigorous grower, and an
abundant bearer. It is well adapted for dwarf or espalier training
when grown on the paradise stock, and ought to find a place in every
collection however small.

Though of American origin this variety succeeds to perfection in this
country; a qualification which few of the American apples possess.


106. EARLY JULIEN.--Hort.

 IDENTIFICATION.--Hort. Trans. vol. v. p. 267. Lind. Guide, 4. Rog. Fr.
 Cult. 32.

Fruit, of medium size, two inches and three quarters wide, and
two inches and a quarter high; roundish, slightly flattened, and
prominently ribbed from the eye downwards to the base. Skin, smooth,
pale yellow, with an orange tinge next the sun, strewed all over with
minute dots and a few whitish specks. Eye, closed with broad segments,
and set in a deep, irregular, and angular basin. Stalk, short, not
extending beyond the base, and inserted in a deep and angular cavity.
Flesh, yellowish-white, crisp, very juicy, and with a brisk, pleasant,
and refreshing flavor.

An excellent early culinary apple, of first-rate quality, ripe in
the second week of August. It might with propriety be called the
Summer Hawthornden, as it equals that esteemed old variety in all its
properties.

The tree is healthy and hardy, but not a large grower. It is, however,
a good bearer, though not so much so as the Hawthornden, and is well
adapted for growing as a dwarf.

This variety is said to be of Scotch origin, but I cannot ascertain
where, or when it was first discovered. It is not mentioned by Gibson,
neither is it enumerated in the catalogue of Leslie and Anderson, of
Edinburgh, or any of the Scotch nurserymen of the last century. It
was first introduced to the south by the late Mr. Hugh Ronalds, of
Brentford, who exhibited it at the London Horticultural Society.

Fruit, medium sized; somewhat oblato-ovate. Skin, dull yellow, covered
with thin brownish grey russet, and marked with large russety dots.
Eye, open, placed in a small, round, and rather shallow basin. Stalk,
half-an-inch long, inserted in a narrow, deep, and russety cavity.
Flesh, yellowish-white, tender, crisp, juicy, and sugary, with a brisk
and rich aromatic flavor, resembling the old Nonpareil.

A delicious apple for the dessert, and of the first quality; it is in
use during October and November, after which it becomes dry and meally.

The tree is a free and upright grower, perfectly hardy, an early and
abundant bearer; even in the nursery quarters it produces freely
when only two years from the graft. It is well adapted for dwarf and
espalier training, when grown on the paradise stock.

This esteemed variety was raised about the year 1780, by a nurseryman
of the name of Stagg, at Caister, near Yarmouth, in Norfolk. The name
of Hicks’s Fancy was given to it by Kirke, formerly a nurseryman at
Brompton, near London, from the circumstance of a person of the name
of Hicks, giving it the preference to the other varieties which were
fruited in the nursery. An instance of the absurd system by which the
names of fruits have been multiplied.


108. EARLY SPICE.--Hort.

 IDENTIFICATION.--Hort. Soc. Cat. ed. 3, n. 786.

Fruit, of medium size, two inches and three quarters wide, and two
inches and a quarter high; roundish, and somewhat angular. Skin,
smooth, of an uniform pale yellow or straw color, and thinly strewed
with greenish dots. Eye, small and open, with long, reflexed segments,
and set in a small basin. Stalk, three quarters of an inch long, deeply
inserted in a rather angular cavity, which is thickly lined with
russet. Flesh, white, tender, marrowy and very juicy; with a pleasant,
refreshing and sub-acid flavor.

An excellent early culinary apple, which is well suited for baking,
and is also good as an eating apple. It is ripe in the first week of
August, but soon becomes woolly after being gathered.

thick and membranous, of an uniform waxen yellow color. Eye, partially
open, with long reflexed segments, and set in a moderately deep basin.
Stalk, long and slender, inserted in a deep and angular cavity, from
which issue prominent ribs. Flesh, yellowish-white, tender and soft,
with a sweet and abundant juice.

A dessert apple of ordinary merit, valuable only for its earliness, as
it ripens in the first week of August, but does not keep any time.


110. ELFORD PIPPIN.--M.

 IDENTIFICATION AND FIGURE.--Maund. Fruit, pl. 45.

Fruit, of medium size, two inches and three quarters wide, and the same
in height; roundish, inclining to ovate, and ribbed round the eye.
Skin, yellowish-green, with markings of russet on the shaded side, but
covered with red, which is striped with darker red on the side next the
sun. Eye, large, and somewhat closed, with broad flat segments like
those of Trumpington, placed in a rather deep and somewhat undulating
basin. Stalk, short, inserted in a rather shallow cavity, which is
lined with delicate yellowish-brown russet. Flesh, yellowish, crisp,
and tender, with a fine, brisk, sugary, and vinous flavor.

An excellent dessert apple of first-rate quality, in use from October
to Christmas. The tree is a healthy and vigorous grower, and a good
bearer.

The Elford Pippin is supposed to have been raised at Elford, near
Lichfield, where it is a very popular variety, and to which locality it
is at present chiefly confined.

streaks and patches of bright crimson on the side exposed to the sun,
the whole strewed with numerous russety dots. Eye, large, and half
open, with broad, erect, and acuminate segments, set in deep, even,
and slightly ribbed basin. Stalk, an inch or more in length, inserted
in a deep, round, and even cavity, which is lined with russet. Flesh,
yellowish-white, tender, crisp, juicy, and sugary, with a pleasant and
slightly aromatic flavor.

A beautiful and valuable apple, both as regards its size and quality.
It is more adapted for culinary than dessert use, but is also desirable
for the latter were it only on account of its noble appearance at the
table. It is in use from September to December.

The tree is a strong and vigorous grower, producing long stout shoots,
is perfectly hardy and a good bearer.

This apple was introduced to this country by Mr. Lee, nurseryman
of Hammersmith, in 1817, and was exhibited by him at the London
Horticultural Society; the specimen produced being five inches and a
half in diameter, four inches deep, sixteen inches in circumference,
and weighed nineteen ounces. It is generally supposed that this was
its first appearance in England; but there can be little doubt that
it is the _Phœnix Apple_ figured by Brookshaw, whose account of it
in 1808, is as follows:--“It was much grown fifty years back in the
neighbourhood of Twickenham, but was rather lost. The late Mr. Ash,
nurseryman at Strawberry Hill, near Twickenham, preserved it from his
father, who had an old tree of it. This specimen came from that tree.
This apple was seen in Russia by an English nobleman, who thought it
so excellent an apple, that he was induced to send some trees of it
to England, and what will appear extraordinary to English gardeners,
they were taken up in the summer with their leaves on, when they could
not be less than twelve years old by their appearance, and when they
arrived, after being six months before they came to hand, they were
planted and produced fruit, and are now fine trees. The apple has a
bloom on it like a red plum when on the tree, and is a very excellent
beautiful apple, ripens in October, and will keep through December. It
is to be had at the late Mr. Ash’s nursery, at Strawberry Hill, near
Twickenham, under the name of Phœnix Apple, from its being lost and
revived.”

inserted. Flesh, white, tender, and agreeably acid.

A culinary apple of first-rate quality; ripe in August and continues in
use till October.

The trees are excellent bearers, but in most orchards they are
generally found unhealthy, cankered, and full of the woolly aphis, a
state produced, according to Mr. Lindley, by their being raised from
suckers, and truncheons stuck into the ground. In the “Guide to the
Orchard,” he says, “Healthy, robust, and substantial trees are only to
be obtained by grafting on stocks of the real Sour Hedge Crab; they
then grow freely, erect, and form very handsome heads, yielding fruit
as superior to those of our old orchards, as the old, and at present
deteriorated Codlin is to the Crab itself.” This circumstance was
noticed by Worlidge nearly two hundred years ago--“You may graft them
on stocks as you do other fruit, which will accelerate and augment
their bearing; but you may save that labor and trouble, if you plant
the Cions, Slips, or Cuttings of them in the spring-time, a little
before their budding; by which means they will prosper very well, and
soon become Trees; but these are more subject to the canker than those
that are grafted.”

This is one of our oldest English apples, and still deserving of
more general cultivation than is at present given to it. Formerly it
constituted one of the principal dishes in English cookery, in the
shape of “Codlings and Cream.” Ray says, “Crudum vix editur ob duritiem
et aciditatem, sed coctum vel cum cremore lactis, vel cum aqua rosacea
et saccharo comestum inter laudatissima fercula habetur.” The name is
derived from _coddle_, to parboil.

Fruit, large, three inches and a quarter wide, and three inches high;
ovate, and regularly formed. Skin, almost entirely covered with clear
bright red, and marked with fawn-colored russety dots, except on a
portion of the shaded side, where it is yellow tinged and streaked with
red. Eye, small and closed, set in a moderately deep and undulating
basin. Stalk, slender, about an inch long, inserted in a wide, round,
and deep cavity. Flesh, yellow, crisp, juicy, richly, and briskly
flavored.

A most excellent dessert apple; in use from November to February.

This is a native of the United States, and is there considered one of
the best dessert apples. Along with the Newtown Pippin it ranks as
one of the most productive and profitable orchard fruits, but like
many, and indeed almost all the best American varieties, it does not
attain to that degree of perfection in this country that it does in its
native soil. The tree is tender and subject to canker, and the fruit
lacks that high flavor, and peculiar richness which characterizes the
imported specimens. It was raised at Esopus, on the Hudson, where it is
still grown to a large extent.


114. ESSEX PIPPIN.--Hort.

 IDENTIFICATION.--Hort. Soc. Cat. ed. 3, n. 239.

Fruit, small; round and flattened, somewhat oblate. Skin, smooth, green
at first, but becoming of a yellowish-green as it ripens, and with a
faint tinge of thin red where exposed to the sun. Eye, open, with long,
reflexed, acuminate segments, placed in a shallow basin. Stalk, three
quarters of an inch long, slender, inserted in a round and even cavity.
Flesh, yellowish, firm, and crisp, with a brisk, sugary, and rich
flavor.

A dessert apple of first-rate quality, nearly allied to the Golden
Pippin; it is in use from October to February.


115. FAIR MAID OF TAUNTON.--Hort.

 IDENTIFICATION.--Hort. Soc. Cat. ed. 3, p. 15

Fruit, small, two inches and a quarter wide, and an inch and three
quarters high; ovato-oblate, and rather irregularly formed. Skin,
smooth and shining, thick and membranous, of a pale straw color, and
with a faint of red on the side exposed to the sun; thickly strewed
all over with small russety dots. Eye, somewhat closed, with broad,
flat segments, which are reflexed at the tips, and set in a shallow
and plaited basin. Stalk, very short, inserted in a wide cavity, which
is lined with rough brown russet. Flesh, yellowish-white, tender, very
juicy, sweet, and though not richly yet pleasantly flavored.

A dessert apple, but not of the first quality; in use from November to
February.


116. FAIR’S NONPAREIL.--Hort.

 IDENTIFICATION.--Hort. Soc. Cat. ed. 3, n. 469.

Fruit, small, two inches and a quarter broad, and two inches high;
ovate, even, and regularly shaped. Skin, tender, of a bright green
color at first, but changing as it attains maturity, to a fine clear
yellow without any tinge of red. Eye, closed, set in a shallow, and
finely plaited basin. Stalk, inserted in a pretty deep cavity, which
has sometimes a fleshy protuberance on one side of it. Flesh, fine,
firm, crisp, and juicy, with a rich, refreshing, sugary, and vinous
flavor.

A dessert apple of first-rate quality, in use from November to February.


117. FAMAGUSTA.--Hort.

 IDENTIFICATION.--Hort Soc. Cat. ed. 3, p. 15.

Fruit, medium sized, about two inches and three quarters wide, and
two inches and a half high; roundish-ovate, somewhat ribbed towards
the eye. Skin, smooth, clear deep yellow, thinly strewed with large
brownish russety dots, on the shaded side, and marked with patches
and veins of thin, delicate, pale brown russet, and a faint tinge of
red on the side exposed to the sun. Eye, closed, set in a narrow and
even basin. Stalk, half-an-inch long, inserted in a narrow and shallow
cavity, which is lined with russet. Flesh, yellowish, tender, sweet,
aqueous, and slightly perfumed.

A culinary apple, in use from December to February.

The Famagusta of the Horticultural Society’s Catalogue cannot be the
original Famagusta mentioned by Rea, Worlidge, and Ray, because Rea
says it is “a fair large _early_ apple,” which is confirmed by Worlidge
placing it “in the number of the best _early_ apples.” The name is,
therefore, now given to a variety different from that to which it was
originally applied, but which may still be in existence in some parts

Fruit, small, about two inches and a quarter broad, and the same in
height; roundish-ovate, and broadest at the base. Skin, of a fine deep
yellow color, like a Golden Pippin, but almost entirely covered with
russet, which is brown on the shaded side, and grey where exposed to
the sun, mixed with a tinge of redish brown. Eye, small and open, set
in a round, wide, and rather deep basin. Stalk, half-an-inch long,
inserted in a rather shallow cavity. Flesh, yellowish-white, tender,
crisp, rich, sugary, and aromatic, partaking much of the flavor of
Anise--hence the origin of one of the synonymes.

An excellent dessert apple, and when well ripened is considered of
first-rate quality by those who are partial to its peculiar flavor. It
is in season from December to March, and at an advanced period becomes
woolly.

The tree is a small and slender grower; but an abundant bearer. It
requires a rich soil and warm situation, and succeeds well as a dwarf
on the paradise stock.

A delicious little dessert apple; in use from December to April.

The tree is a free grower, quite hardy, and an excellent bearer; but
requires a light and warm soil.

According to Knoop, this apple is called Pomme de Caractère, from
the linear tracings of russet with which it is covered, being so
disposed as to give it the appearance of being marked with letters or
_characters_.

covered with dark grey russet as to leave none of the ground color
visible, except that portion exposed to the sun, which is dark redish
brown. Eye, large and closed, set in a wide and rather shallow basin.
Stalk, about an inch long, sometimes obliquely inserted, by the
side of a fleshy prominence, in a wide and shallow cavity. Flesh,
greenish-white, firm, rich, sugary, and highly perfumed with the flavor
of anise or fennel.

An excellent dessert apple; in use from November to January.

The tree is a small grower, but an abundant bearer, and requires a warm
and rich soil to have the fruit in perfection.


124. FILL-BASKET.--H.

Fruit, medium sized, two inches and a half wide, and the same in
height; conical, round at the base, flattened at the apex, and
distinctly angular on the sides. Skin, pale dull greenish-yellow on the
shaded side, and streaked with broken patches and pencilings of pale
red, where exposed to the sun, the whole covered with russety dots.
Eye, closed, as if drawn together or puckered, placed level with the
flat crown, and with a small knob or wart at the base of each segment.
Stalk, three quarters of an inch long, thickest at the insertion, and
placed in a small, round, and shallow cavity, which is surrounded with
dark brown russet. Flesh, greenish-white, tender, juicy, and acid, with
a brisk and pleasant flavor.

An excellent culinary apple, extensively grown in the neighbourhood of
Lancaster, where it is highly esteemed; it is in use from October to
January.

This, which may be called the Lancashire Fill-basket, is very different
from the Kentish variety of that name.


125. FLANDERS PIPPIN.--H.

Fruit, medium sized, three inches wide, and two and a quarter high;
oblate, and marked on the sides with ten distinct angles, five of which
are more prominent than the others. Skin, pale green, changing to pale
greenish-yellow as it ripens, and occasionally tinged with a cloud
of thin dull red on the side exposed to the sun, and thinly strewed
with a few dots. Eye, closed, with long and downy segments, set in a
narrow and ribbed basin. Stalk, from half-an-inch to an inch in length,
slender, and inserted in a deep funnel-shaped cavity, which is lined
with russet. Flesh, white, tender, and marrowy, juicy, and briskly
flavored.

A culinary apple of second-rate quality; in use during October and
November.

It is much grown in the Berkshire orchards.

prominent knobs on the apex. Skin, greenish-yellow, thickly strewed
with green dots on the shaded side; but next the sun, dull red marked
with patches and streaks of livelier red, and dotted with light grey
dots. Eye, large and open, with broad reflexed segments, and placed
in a large angular basin, which is marked with russet. Stalk, an
inch long, thick and strong, deeply set in an angular cavity. Flesh,
greenish-white, firm, crisp, and juicy, with a pleasant and briskly
acid flavor.

A culinary apple of first-rate quality; in use from November to January.

The tree is a pretty good bearer, one of the strongest and most
vigorous growers, and consequently more suitable for the orchard than
the fruit garden.

This is a very old variety, being mentioned by Parkinson, Leonard
Meager, and Ray, but there is no notice of it in the works of any
subsequent writer till the publication of Forsyth’s Treatise.


127. FLUSHING SPITZENBURGH.--Down.

 IDENTIFICATION.--Down. Fr. Amer. 139.

Fruit, medium sized; roundish, narrowing towards the eye. Skin,
entirely covered with deep red, which is streaked with deeper red,
except on any small portion where it has been shaded, and there it is
green, marked with broken streaks and mottles of red, the whole surface
strewed with light grey russety dots. Eye, small and closed, very
slightly depressed, and surrounded with plaits. Stalk, nearly an inch
long, inserted in a deep and russety cavity. Flesh, greenish, tender,
sweet, juicy, and without any predominance of acid.

An American dessert apple of little value; in use from October to
January.

In the Horticultural Society’s Catalogue this is made synonymous with
Esopus Spitzenburgh, but it is quite a different variety.

Fruit, below medium size; roundish, inclining to oblate, regularly
and handsomely shaped. Skin, pale yellow, with a blush of red on the
side which is exposed to the sun. Eye, small and closed, with short
obtuse segments, set in a shallow and plaited basin. Stalk, very short,
inserted in a shallow cavity. Flesh, firm.

Specific gravity of the juice from 1076 to 1081.

This is a fine old Gloucestershire cider apple, which is extensively
cultivated on the thin limestone soils of the Forest of Dean. The cider
that it produces is strong bodied, rich, and highly flavored.

The tree produces numerous straight, luxuriant, upward shoots, like
a pollard willow; it runs much to wood, and in deep soils attains a
considerable size before it becomes fruitful.


129. FORGE.--H.

[Illustration]

Fruit, medium sized; roundish, obscurely ribbed, and sometimes
narrowing towards the eye, where it is angular. Skin, smooth and
shining, of a fine golden yellow color, strewed with mottles of crimson
on the shaded side; and dark red marked with patches of deep crimson
on the side exposed to the sun; sometimes when much exposed to the sun
the yellow assumes a deep orange tinge. Eye, small and closed, set in
an angular basin. Stalk, very short, not a quarter of an inch long,
inserted in a small, round, and shallow cavity, surrounded with thick
russet. Flesh, yellowish-white, tender, mellow, juicy, sweet, and
finely perfumed.

A beautiful and valuable apple, suitable either for the dessert,
culinary use, or for the manufacture of cider. It is in use from
October to January.

The tree attains about the middle size, is perfectly hardy and healthy,
and quite free from canker and disease. It is a most abundant and
regular bearer.

I am surprised that this beautiful apple has hitherto escaped the
notice of pomologists, it being so universally grown, and generally
popular, in the district to which it belongs. In the north-eastern
parts of Sussex, and the adjoining county of Surrey, it is extensively
cultivated, and I believe there is scarcely a cottager’s garden where
it is not to be met with, nor is there a cottager to whom its name
is not as familiar as his own, it being considered to supply all the
qualifications that a valuable apple is supposed to possess; and
although this judgment is formed in contrast with the other varieties
grown in the district, nevertheless, the Forge is a useful and valuable
apple, particularly to a cottager, whether we consider its great
productiveness, its uses as a dessert and excellent cooking apple, or
the excellent cider which it produces. It is said to have originated at
a blacksmith’s forge near East Grinstead.

pale, thin, yellowish-brown russet. Eye, small and open, set in a
shallow and plaited basin. Stalk, short, not deeply inserted. Flesh,
greenish-yellow, juicy, rich, and highly flavored, with much of the
flavor of the Nonpareil and Golden Pippin.

An excellent dessert apple of first-rate quality; it comes into use in
November, and keeps till April.

The tree is a great bearer, but tender and subject to canker.

It is well adapted for dwarf training when worked on the paradise stock.

This variety was raised by Thomas Seton Forman, Esq., Pennydarron

the side exposed to the sun, strewed all over with small russety dots.
Eye, small and open, set in a narrow and shallow basin. Stalk, three
quarters of an inch long, inserted in a round and moderately deep
cavity. Flesh, yellowish, tender, very juicy, and briskly acid.

An excellent culinary apple, and suitable also for the dessert; in use
from November to March.

yellow on the shaded side; and bright redish-orange on the side exposed
to the sun. Eye, small and closed, not depressed, and surrounded with
a few knobs. Stalk, about an inch long, inserted in a shallow cavity,
which is lined with russet. Flesh, yellow.

Specific gravity of the juice 1080.

A valuable cider apple.

This variety was raised by Thomas Andrew Knight, Esq., from the Cherry
Apple, impregnated with the pollen of the Golden Pippin. It was named
Foxley from the seat of the late Uvedale Price, Esq., in whose garden,
where it had been grafted, it first attained maturity. Mr. Knight says,
“there is no situation where the common Wild Crab will produce fruit,
in which the Foxley will not produce a fine cider.”

 FIGURE.--Pom. Heref. t. 3.

Fruit, medium sized; ovate, and irregularly shaped, with prominent
angles on the sides. Skin, yellow and red, mixed with a good deal of
deeper red streaked all over the fruit.

Specific gravity of the juice 1076 when the fruit is healthy; and when
small and shrivelled it is 1080.

The juice of this variety is extremely rich and saccharine, and enters
in a greater or less proportion into the composition of many of the
finest ciders in Herefordshire, to which it communicates both strength
and flavor.

This is one of the oldest of our cider apples, and is enumerated by
Evelyn; but is not so highly extolled as the Redstreak, and some other
varieties. In Evelyn’s “Advertisements concerning Cider,” a “person of
great experience,” says “Cider for strength and a long lasting drink
is best made of the _Fox-Whelp_ of the _Forest of Dean_, but which
comes not to be drunk till two or three years old.” By Worlidge it was
“esteemed among the choice cider fruits.”

with fine russet, particularly round the apex. Eye, small, with long
narrow segments overlapping each other, partially open, and set in a
wide and deep basin. Stalk, short and slender, about half-an-inch long,
inserted in a round, narrow, and smooth cavity. Flesh, yellow, tender,
and crisp, very juicy, vinous, and aromatic.

A dessert apple of first-rate quality; in use from October to December.

The tree does not attain a large size, but is vigorous, healthy, and
hardy, and an excellent bearer. It is well suited for a dwarf or
espalier, and succeeds well on the paradise stock.

This is of American origin, and was introduced to this country by John
Sudlow, Esq., of Thames Ditton, and first exhibited at the London
Horticultural Society in 1819.

Fruit, of good size; somewhat conical, being broad at the base, and
narrow at the crown. Skin, dark grass-green on the shaded side;
and dark muddy livid red where exposed to the sun. Eye, sunk, and
surrounded by four or five obtuse but prominent ridges. Stalk, short
and stiff, notwithstanding which the fruit is generally pendant.

Specific gravity of its juice 1073.

This is a cider apple cultivated in the north-west parts of
Herefordshire, where the climate is cold, and the soil unfavourable,
and where proper attention is never paid by the farmer to the
management of his cider, which in consequence is generally fit only for
the ordinary purposes of a farm-house.--_Knight._

The trees are vigorous and productive.

Mr. Knight says, “The Friar probably derived its name from some
imagined resemblance between its color and that of the countenance of a
well-fed ecclesiastic.”

covered with broken stripes of dark dull red on the side next the sun.
Eye, large and closed, moderately depressed, and surrounded with broad
plaits. Stalk, short and slender, deeply inserted in a narrow and

Fruit, immensely large, sometimes measuring four inches and a half in
diameter; of a roundish shape, angular on the sides, and flattened
both at the base and the apex. Skin, smooth, pale yellowish-green,
interspersed with white dots and patches of thin delicate russet, and
tinged with a faint blush of red next the sun. Eye, large, open, and
deeply set in a wide and slightly furrowed basin. Stalk, short and
stout, inserted in a deep and open cavity, which is lined with rough
russet. Flesh, white, tender, juicy, and though not highly flavored, is
an excellent culinary apple.

It is in use from October to Christmas.

This variety is of American origin, but some doubts exist as to where
it was first raised, that honor being claimed by several different
localities. The general opinion, however, is, that it originated in
the garden of a Mr. Smith, in the neighbourhood of Baltimore, and was
first brought over to this country by Captain George Hudson, of the
ship Belvedere, of Baltimore, in 1817. It was introduced from America
into France by Comte Lelieur, in 1804. But from the account given in
the Allgemeines Teutsches Gärtenmagazin, it is doubtful whether it is
a native of America, for in the volume of that work for 1805, it is
said to have been raised by Herr Künstgartner Maszman, of Hanover. If
that account is correct, its existence in America is in all probability
owing to its having been taken thither by some Hanoverian emigrants.
At page 41, vol. iii., Dittrich has confounded the synonymes of the
_Gloria Mundi_ with _Golden Mundi_, which he has described under the
name of _Monstow’s Pepping_.


140. GLORY OF ENGLAND.--H.

Fruit, large, three inches and a half wide, and over two inches and
three quarters high; ovate, somewhat of the shape of Emperor Alexander,
ribbed on the sides, and terminated round the eye by a number of
puckered-like knobs. Skin, dull greenish-yellow, with numerous embedded
whitish specks, particularly round the eye, and covered with large dark
russety dots, and linear marks of russet; but on the side exposed to
the sun it is of a deeper yellow, with a few broken streaks and dots of
crimson. Eye, small and slightly closed, set in a shallow and puckered
basin. Stalk, short and fleshy, inserted in a wide, deep, and russety
cavity. Flesh, greenish-yellow, tender, soft, juicy, sprightly, and
slightly perfumed.

An excellent culinary apple; in use from October to January.


141. GLORY OF THE WEST.--Diel.

 IDENTIFICATION.--Diel Kernobst. xii. 83.

Fruit, large, three inches and a quarter broad, and two inches and
three quarters high; oblate, ridged and angular about the eye, and
ribbed on the sides. Skin, smooth and shining, yellow, mixed in some
parts with a tinge of green, and washed with thin clear red on the
side next the sun; the whole surface is strewed with minute russety
dots, and several large dark spots, such as are often met with on the
Hawthornden. Eye, large, with long segments, and set in an angular
basin. Stalk, three quarters of an inch long, inserted in a deep
cavity, which is surrounded with a large patch of rough grey russet.
Flesh, yellowish-white, firm but tender, very juicy, with a pleasant,
brisk, and slightly perfumed flavor.

A culinary apple of first quality; it is in use the end of October and
continues till Christmas.

The tree is a strong and vigorous grower, attaining a great size, and
is an excellent bearer.

I had this variety from Mr. James Lake, of Bridgewater, and it is
evidently identical with the Glory of the West of Diel, a name which,
according to Lindley, is sometimes applied to the Dutch Codlin. The
variety here described bears a considerable resemblance to that known
by the name of Turk’s Cap.

[Illustration]

Fruit, small; oblato-cylindrical, even and free from angles. Skin,
entirely covered with rough scaly russet, with sometimes a patch of
the yellow ground color exposed on the shaded side, and covered with
brownish-red on the side next the sun. Eye, small and open, with very
short, reflexed segments, set in a wide, shallow, and slightly plaited
basin. Stalk, half-an-inch long, inserted in a shallow cavity. Flesh,
yellow, firm, crisp, juicy, sugary, with an exceedingly rich and
powerful aromatic flavor.

This is one of the richest and most excellent dessert apples; it is
in use from December to May; but is very apt to shrivel if exposed to
light and air as most russety apples are.

The tree is a free grower, and perfectly hardy. It attains about the
middle size and is an excellent bearer. When grown on the paradise
stock it is well adapted for dwarf training, and forms a good espalier.

Independently of being one of the best dessert apples, it is also one
of the best for cider; and from the great strength of its juice, the
specific gravity of which is 1085, it has been called the _Brandy
Apple_.

 SYNONYME.--Kentish Golden Knob, _Nursery Catalogues_.

 FIGURE.--Ron. Pyr. Mal. pl. xxxii. f. 9.

Fruit, below medium size, two inches and a quarter wide, and the
same in height; ovate, sometimes a little flattened, which gives it
a roundish shape. Skin, pale green, becoming yellowish-green as it
attains maturity; much covered with russet round the base and on the
shaded side; but yellow, marked with streaks of a redish tinge, with
crimson dots next the sun, and thickly strewed all over with large
freckles of russet. Eye, open, generally with long segments, but in the
roundish specimens they are short and stunted, and placed in a shallow
basin. Stalk, very short, and quite embedded in the cavity. Flesh,
greenish-white, firm, crisp, and very juicy, of a brisk, sweet flavor.

A good dessert apple, of second-rate quality; in use from December to
March.

The tree is hardy and a vigorous grower, producing enormous crops,
and on that account extensively cultivated, particularly in Kent, for
the supply of the London markets. Though a good apple it is one more
deserving the attention of the orchardist than the fruit gardener.


145. GOLDEN MONDAY.--Switz.

 SYNONYME.--Monstow’s Pepping, _Ditt. Handb._ iii. 41.

Fruit, small, about two inches and a half wide, and two inches high;
roundish, inclining to oblate. Skin, smooth, pale grass green on
the shaded side; but fine clear golden yellow dotted with crimson
dots, on the side exposed to the sun, and in some parts marked with
ramifications of very thin delicate brown russet, which generally issue
from the basin of the eye. Eye, small, and rather open, with narrow,
acute, and stiff segments, set in a narrow and plaited basin. Stalk,
very short, not a quarter of an inch long, quite embedded in a narrow,
round, and rather deep cavity, which, with the base, is covered with
very thick and rough scaly russet. Flesh, yellowish-white, crisp, not
very juicy, sugary, brisk, and perfumed, not unlike the flavor of the
Golden Pippin.

A very excellent dessert apple of first-rate quality; in use from
October to Christmas.

I do not know what the Golden Mundi of Forsyth is, which he describes
as a fine handsome apple, beautifully streaked with red; but that now
described is the Golden Monday of the Berkshire orchards, and the same
as has been cultivated in the Brompton Park nursery for upwards of a
hundred years.

The Golden Russet is sometimes called by the name of Golden Monday, but
it is a very distinct variety from this.


146. GOLDEN NOBLE.--Hort.

 IDENTIFICATION.--Hort. Trans. vol. iv., p. 524. Hort. Soc. Cat. ed. 3,
 n. 280. Lind. Guide, 49.

Fruit, large; round, and narrowing towards the eye, handsome. Skin,
smooth, clear bright yellow, without any blush of red, but a few small
redish spots and small patches of russet. Eye, small, set in a round
and deep basin, surrounded with plaits. Stalk, short, with a fleshy
growth on one side of it, which connects it with the fruit. Flesh,
yellow, tender, with a pleasant acid juice, and baking of a clear amber
color, perfectly melting, with a rich acidity.

A valuable culinary apple; in use from September to December.

This was first brought into notice by Sir Thomas Harr, of Stowe Hall,
Norfolk, whose gardener procured it from a tree supposed to be the
original, in an old orchard at Downham, and communicated it to the
Horticultural Society of London, in 1820.

 FIGURE.--Ron. Pyr. Mal. pl. xxiii. f. 6.

Fruit, medium sized, about two inches and a half in diameter, and the
same in height; abrupt pearmain-shaped, irregularly ribbed on the
sides, and uneven at the apex. Skin, pale yellow, strewed with patches
of russet, and covered with minute russety dots on the shaded side;
but deep redish orange, streaked with deeper color, and strewed with
minute russety dots on the side exposed to the sun. Eye, large and
open, with reflexed segments, and set in a wide, deep, and angular
basin. Stalk, slender, three quarters of an inch long, and obliquely
inserted, with frequently a fleshy protuberance on one side of it,
in a rather shallow cavity, which is lined with green russet. Flesh,
yellowish, firm, crisp, very juicy, sweet, and lacking acidity, which
gives it a sickly flavor.

An apple of second-rate quality, suitable either for culinary purposes
or the dessert; in use from November to March.

The tree is an upright grower and a free bearer, but requires to be
grown in good soil.

In America this is esteemed as a cider apple.

[Illustration]

Fruit, small; roundish, inclining to oblong, regularly and handsomely
shaped, without inequalities or angles on the sides. Skin, rich yellow,
assuming a deep golden tinge when perfectly ripe, with a deeper tinge
where it has been exposed to the sun; the whole surface is strewed with
russety dots, which are largest on the sunny side, and intermixed with
these are numerous embedded pearly specks. Eye, small and open, with
long segments, placed in a shallow, smooth, and even basin. Stalk, from
half-an-inch to an inch in length, inserted in a pretty deep cavity.
Flesh, yellow, firm, crisp, very juicy and sugary, with a brisk,
vinous, and particularly fine flavor.

One of the oldest and by far the most highly esteemed of our dessert
apples, and neither the Borsdorffer of the Germans, the Reinette of
the French, nor the Newtown Pippin of the Americans, will ever occupy
in the estimation of the English the place now accorded to the Golden
Pippin. It is also an excellent cider apple. The specific gravity of
its juice is 1078.

It is in season from November to April.

The tree is a free and vigorous grower, but does not attain a great
size. It is also an excellent bearer.

When and where the Golden Pippin was first discovered, are now matters
of uncertainty; but all writers agree in ascribing to it an English
origin, some supposing it to have originated at Parham Park, near
Arundel, in Sussex. Although it is not recorded at so early a period
as some others, there is no doubt it is a very old variety. It is
not, however, the “Golding Pippin” of Parkinson, for he says “it is
the _greatest_ and best of all sorts of Pippins.” It was perhaps this
circumstance that led Mr. Knight to remark, that from the description
Parkinson has given of the apples cultivated in his time, it is evident
that those now known by the same names, are different, and probably
new varieties. But this is no evidence of such being the case, for I
find there were two sorts of Golden Pippin, the “Great Golding,” and
the “Small Golding, or Bayford,” both of which are mentioned by Leonard
Meager, and there is no doubt the “Golding Pippin,” of Parkinson, was
the “Great Golding.” Whether it was because it was little known, or its
qualities were unappreciated, that the writers of the 17th century were
so restrictive in their praises of the Golden Pippin, it is difficult
to say; but true it is whilst Pearmains, Red Streaks, Codlings, and
Catsheads, are set forth as the desiderata of an orchard, the Golden
Pippin is but rarely noticed. Ralph Austin calls it “a very speciall
apple and great bearer.” Evelyn certainly states that Lord Clarendon
cultivated it, but it was only as a cider apple: for he says “at
Lord Clarendon’s seat at Swallowfield, Berks, there is an orchard of
1000 Golden _and other cider_ Pippins.” In his Treatise on Cider he
frequently notices it as a cider apple; but never in any place that I
can recollect of as a dessert fruit. In the Pomona, he says, “About
London and the southern tracts, the Pippin, and especially the Golden,
is esteemed for making the most delicious cider, most wholesome, and
most restorative.” Worlidge merely notices it as “smaller than the
Orange Apple, else much like it in color, taste, and long keeping.”
Ray seems the first who fully appreciated it, for after minutely and
correctly describing it, he says, “Ad omnes culinæ usus præstantissimum
habetur, et Pomaceo conficiendo egregium.” De Quintinye’s remarks are
not at all complimentary. He says it has altogether the character of
the paradise or some other wild apple, it is extremely yellow and
round, little juice, which is pretty rich, and without bad flavor.
But the Jardinier Solitaire, more impartial, or with better judgment,
says, “son eau est tres sucrée; elle a le goût plus relevé que la
Reynette; c’est ce que luy donne le mérite d’être reconnuë pour une
tres excellente pomme.” The opinion of Angran de Rueneuve is also worth
recording.

“La Pomme d’Or est venuë d’Angleterre; on l’y apelle Goule-Pepin.
J’estime qu’elle doit être la Reyne des Pommes, et que la Reynette ne
doit marche qu’aprés elle; car elle est d’un plus fin relief que toutes
les autres Pommes.” Switzer calls it “the most antient, as well as most
excellent apple that is.” But it is not my intention to record all that
has been written in praise of the Golden Pippin, for that of itself
would occupy too much space, my object in making these extracts being
simply to show the gradual progress of its popularity.

The late President of the London Horticultural Society, T. A. Knight,
Esq., considered that the Golden Pippin, and all the old varieties of
English apples, were in the last stage of decay, and that a few years
would witness their total extinction. This belief he founded upon the
degenerate state of these varieties in the Herefordshire orchards, and
also upon his theory that no variety of apple will continue to exist
more than 200 years. But that illustrious man never fell into a greater
error. It would be needless to enter into any further discussion upon
a subject concerning which so much has already been said and written,
as there is sufficient evidence to confute that theory. The Pearmain,
which is the oldest English apple on record, shows no symptoms of
decay, neither does the Catshead, London Pippin, Winter Quoining, or
any other variety; those only _having been allowed to disappear_ from
our orchards, which were not worth perpetuating, and their places
supplied by others infinitely superior.

It is now considerably upwards of half a century since this doctrine
was first promulgated, and though the old, exhausted, and diseased
trees of the Herefordshire orchards, of which Mr. Knight spoke,
together with their _diseased_ progeny--now that they have performed
their part, and fulfilled the end of their existence--may ere this have
passed away, we have the Golden Pippin still, in all the luxuriance of
early youth, where it is found in a soil congenial to its growth; and
exhibiting as little symptoms of decay as any of the varieties which
Mr. Knight raised to supply the vacancy he expected it to create.

In the Brompton Park Nursery, where the same Golden Pippin has been
cultivated for nearly two centuries, and continued from year to year by
grafts taken from young trees in the nursery quarters, I never saw the
least disposition to disease, canker, or decay of any kind; but, on the
contrary, a free, vigorous, and healthy growth.

But this alarm of Mr. Knight for the safety of the Golden Pippin, and
his fear of its extinction, were based upon no new doctrine, for we
find Mortimer a hundred years before, equally lamenting the Kentish
Pippin. After speaking of manures, &c., for the regeneration of fruit
trees, he says, “I shall be glad if this account may put any upon the
trial of raising that excellent fruit the Kentish Pippin, which else,
I fear, will be lost. For I find in several orchards, both in Kent,
Essex, and Hertfordshire, old trees of that sort, but I can find no
young ones to prosper. A friend of mine tried a great many experiments
in Hertfordshire, about raising them, and could never get them to
thrive, though he had old trees in the same orchard that grew and bore
very well. I likewise tried several experiments myself, and have had
young trees thrive so well, as to make many shoots of a yard long in
a year, but these young shoots were always blasted the next year, or
cankered; which makes me think that the ancients had some particular
way of raising them, that we have lost the knowledge of.” Although this
was written a hundred and fifty years ago, we have the Kentish Pippin
still, which though not so much cultivated, or so well known now as
then, is nevertheless where it does exist as vigorous and healthy as
ever it was.

deeper and livelier red, and dotted all over with russety dots. Eye,
large and open, with short dry segments, and set in a wide and even
basin. Stalk, half-an-inch long, deeply inserted in a round and even
cavity. Flesh, yellow, crisp, brisk, juicy, rich, and sugary.

A fine old dessert apple of first-rate quality; it is in use from
November to April.

The tree is healthy, vigorous, and an abundant bearer. It requires a
light and warm soil, and is well adapted for dwarf training when worked
on the paradise stock. Large quantities of this fruit are grown in the
counties round London for the supply of the different markets, where
they always command a high price.

This variety has been long known in this country and esteemed as one of
the finest apples. Worlidge, in 1676, says, “It is to be preferred in
our plantations for all occasions.” Ellis, in his “Modern Husbandman,”
1744, says, “The Golden Rennet, when of the largest sort, may be truly
said to be the farmer’s greatest favorite apple, because when all
others miss bearing, this generally stands his friend, and bears him
large quantities on one tree.”

base; and sometimes with a little bright red on the side next the sun.
Eye, small and closed, set in a prominently plaited basin. Stalk, very
short, inserted in an uneven cavity, and not protruding beyond the
base. Flesh, pale yellow, firm, crisp, sugary, and aromatic; but not
abounding in juice.

An excellent dessert apple of first-rate quality; in use from December
to March.

The tree is healthy and an excellent bearer, but requires a warm
situation to bring the fruit to perfection.

This is another of our old English apples. Worlidge calls it the
Aromatick, or Golden Russeting, “it hath no compear, it being of a
gold-color coat, under a russet hair, with some warts on it. It lives
over the winter, and is, without dispute, the most pleasant apple that
grows; having a most delicate aromatick hautgust, and melting in the
mouth.”

orange, marked with streaks and mottles of crimson, and strewed with
russety dots. Eye, large and open, with long, acuminate, and reflexed
segments; and placed in a round, even, and rather deep basin. Stalk,
three quarters of an inch long, stout, and inserted in a rather shallow
cavity, which is lined with thin pale brown russet mixed with a tinge
of green. Flesh, yellowish-white, firm, breaking, juicy, and sweet;
with a pleasant and somewhat aromatic flavor.

A beautiful and very handsome apple of first-rate quality, and suitable
either for the dessert or for culinary purposes; it is in use from the
end of October to January.

The tree is a strong and vigorous grower, a most abundant bearer, and
attains a considerable size. It is perfectly hardy, and will grow in
almost any situation.

This variety was first brought into notice by Mr. Kirke, a nurseryman,
at Brompton, under the name of _King of the Pippins_. I have, however,
thought it advisable to discontinue that name in connection with this
variety, because Diel previously possessed and described it under the
name of _Golden Winter Pearmain_, which is much more appropriate; and
the name of King of the Pippins belongs to another and very distinct
variety.--_See No. 199_.

basin. Stalk, three quarters of an inch long, inserted in a deep,
round, and slightly russety cavity. Flesh, greenish-white, very tender,
delicate, and marrowy, juicy, brisk, and pleasantly flavored.

A culinary apple of the finest quality, and surpassed by none for the
purpose to which it is applicable; it is in use from October to January.

This is a valuable apple to the market gardener, and is now extensively
cultivated in the Kentish orchards, particularly about Faversham, and
Sittingbourne, for the supply of the London Markets. This is a very
different apple from the Gooseberry Pippin of Ronald’s Pyrus Malus

ribs of which extend from the base even to the eye. Skin, smooth, clear
pale waxen-yellow, streaked and dotted with lively crimson, intermixed
with orange, on the side next the sun. Eye, large and open, with
long segments, which are a little reflexed, and set in an irregular,
angular, and knobbed basin, which is sometimes lined with fine delicate
russet, and dotted round the margin with minute russety dots. Stalk,
very short, but sometimes three quarters of an inch long, set in a
deep and angular cavity. Flesh, white, crisp, very juicy, with a rich,
vinous, and powerful aromatic flavor; and if held up between the eye
and the light, with the hand placed on the margin of the basin of the
eye, it exhibits a transparency like porcelain.

This is a very valuable apple of the first quality, and is equally
desirable either for the dessert or culinary purposes; it is in use
from October to December.

The tree is hardy, a vigorous and healthy grower, and generally a good
bearer. It has somewhat of a pyramidal habit of growth, and attains a
considerable size.

Though not of recent introduction, this beautiful and excellent apple
is comparatively but little known, otherwise it would be more generally
cultivated. It is one of the favorite apples of Germany, particularly
about Hamburgh, and in Holstein, where it is said to have originated in
the garden of the Duke of Augustenberg, at the Castle of Grafenstein.
The original tree is said to have been in existence about the middle of
the last century. According to Diel some suppose it to be of Italian
origin.

as it ripens to yellowish-green; next the sun it is quite yellow,
strewed with minute russety dots, and a few dots of red. Eye, small and
closed, set in a shallow basin, and surrounded with prominent plaits.
Stalk, short, inserted in a rather deep cavity. Flesh, white, crisp,
tender, very juicy, and pleasantly acid.

A most excellent culinary apple; in use from September to December.

This is an esteemed variety in Lancashire, where it is extensively
cultivated.

The tree is a free grower and an excellent bearer.

tinged with green, on the shaded side; but covered with beautiful
bright red on the side next the sun, and marked with several patches of
thin delicate russet. Eye, closed, with long flat segments, placed in a
round, rather deep, and plaited basin. Stalk, very short, inserted in
a wide cavity. Flesh, pale yellowish-white, tender, juicy, sweet, and
briskly flavored.

An excellent apple, either for culinary or dessert use.

In the northern counties it is a popular and highly esteemed variety,
and ranks as a first-rate fruit. It is in use from October to December.

The tree is hardy and healthy; it does not attain a large size, but is
an abundant bearer. When grown against a wall, as it is sometimes in
the North of England, and border counties, the fruit attains a large
size, and is particularly handsome and beautiful.

This variety was first discovered growing in the garden of a shoemaker,
at Keswick, named Greenup, and was first cultivated and made public by
Clarke and Atkinson, nurserymen at that place about fifty years ago.
It is now much cultivated throughout the border counties, and is a
valuable apple where the more choice varieties do not attain perfection.

 SYNONYMES.--Leadington’s Grauer Pipping, _Diel Kernobst._ x. 144. Gray
 Leadington Pippin, _Ibid._

Fruit, medium sized, two inches and a half wide, and the same in
height; oblong or conical, and slightly angular on the sides. Skin,
greenish-yellow, covered with cinnamon-colored russet, on the shaded
side, and pale red when exposed to the sun; the whole covered with
whitish-grey dots. Eye, large and open, with long acuminate segments,
and set in a rather deep basin. Stalk, short and stout, inserted in a
pretty deep cavity. Flesh, white, firm, tender, very juicy, and of a
rich, vinous, sugary, and aromatic flavor.

An excellent apple of first-rate quality, desirable either for the
dessert or for culinary purposes; it is in use from September to
January.

The tree is a strong grower, vigorous, hardy, and an excellent bearer.
It succeeds well as a dwarf on the paradise stock.

This is a favorite apple in Scotland, where it ranks among the best
dessert fruits.

Fruit, medium sized, two inches and a half wide, and two inches high;
roundish and flattened, broadest at the base, and narrowing towards the
eye, sometimes slightly angled. Skin, smooth, pale greenish-yellow,
with a few streaks of red where shaded; and entirely covered with
red, which is striated with deeper red where exposed to the sun. Eye,
small and open, set in a narrow, round, and rather deep basin. Stalk,
half-an-inch long, inserted in a wide and deep cavity, which is lined
with dark brown russet. Flesh, greenish-white, crisp, firm, juicy,

162. HAGLOE CRAB.--Knight.

 IDENTIFICATION.--Pom. Heref. t. 5. Fors. Treat. 106. Lind. Guide, 107.

Fruit, small, two inches wide, and the same in height; ovate,
flattened, and irregularly shaped. Skin, pale yellow, streaked with red
next the sun, and covered with a few patches of grey russet. Eye, open,
with flat, reflexed segments. Stalk, short. Flesh, soft and woolly, but
not dry.

Specific gravity of its juice 1081.

This is a most excellent cider apple; the liquor it produces being
remarkable for its strength, richness, and high flavor. It requires,
however, to be grown in certain situations; a dry soil with a
calcareous subsoil, being considered the best adapted for producing its
cider in perfection. Marshall says, “It was raised from seed by Mr.
Bellamy, of Hagloe, in Gloucestershire, grandfather of the present Mr.
Bellamy, near Ross, in Herefordshire, who draws from it (that is, from
trees grafted with scions from this parent stock) a liquor, which for
richness, flavor, and _pure on the spot_, exceeds perhaps every other
fruit liquor which nature and art have produced. He has been offered
sixty guineas for a hogshead (about 110 gallons) of this liquor. He has
likewise been offered bottle for bottle of wine, or spirituous liquors,
the best to be produced; and this without freight, duty, or even a mile
of carriage to enhance its original price.”

red, on the side next the sun. Eye, small and closed, set in a rather
shallow basin. Stalk, short, inserted in a shallow cavity. Flesh,
greenish-white, firm, crisp, not very juicy, but richly and briskly
flavored.

One of the most valuable culinary apples, and not unworthy of the
dessert; it is in use from January to May, and is an excellent keeper.

This variety originated at Hambledon, a village in Hampshire, where
there are several trees of a great age now in existence.


165. HANWELL SOURING.--Hort.

basin, which is lined with russet. Stalk, very short, inserted in an
even funnel-shaped cavity, from which issue ramifications of russet.
Flesh, white, firm, crisp, with a brisk and poignant acid flavor.

An excellent culinary apple of first-rate quality; in use in December
and keeps till March, when it possesses more acidity than any other
variety which keeps to so late a period.

It is said to have been raised at Hanwell, a place near Banbury, in
Oxfordshire.


166. HARGREAVE’S GREEN-SWEET.--H.

Fruit, medium sized, two inches and three quarters wide, and two
inches and a half high; oblato-cylindrical, angular on the sides, with
prominent ridges round the eye. Skin, yellow, tinged with green, on
the shaded side; but deeper yellow tinged with green, and marked with

termination of the costal angles. Stalk, three quarters of an inch
long, slender, and inserted in a deep, round cavity, which is lined
with rough russet. Flesh, yellowish, tender, juicy, sweet, and perfumed.

A good dessert apple but lacks acidity; it is in use during September
and October.

About Lancaster this is a well-known apple. The original tree, which is
of great age, is still standing in the nursery of John Hargreave and
Sons, hence it is called Hargreave’s Green-Sweet.

 SYNONYME.--Doctor Harvey, _Hort. Soc. Cat._ ed. 3, n. 208.

Fruit, large, three inches wide, and about the same high; ovate, and
somewhat angular. Skin, greenish-yellow, dotted with green and white
specks, and marked with ramifications of russet about the apex. Eye,
small, very slightly depressed, and surrounded with several prominent
plaits. Stalk, short and slender, inserted in an uneven and deep
cavity. Flesh, white, firm, crisp, juicy, pleasantly acid, and perfumed.

A culinary apple of first-rate quality, well-known and extensively
cultivated in Norfolk; it is in use from October to January.

The tree is large, hardy, and a great bearer.

In the Guide to the Orchard, it is said, “When baked in an oven which
is not too hot, these apples are most excellent; they become sugary,
and will keep a week or ten days, furnishing for the dessert a highly
flavored sweetmeat.”

This is one of the oldest English apples. It is first mentioned by
Parkinson as “a faire, greate, goodly apple; and very well rellished.”
Ralph Austen calls it “a very choice fruit, and the trees beare well.”
Indeed it is noticed by almost all the early authors. According to
Ray it is named in honor of Dr. Gabriel Harvey, of Cambridge, “Pomum
Harveianum ab inventore Gabriele Harveio Doctore nomen sortitum
Cantabrigiæ suæ deliciæ.”

Fruit, medium sized; roundish. Skin, yellow on the shaded side, but
washed with fine red on the side next the sun, and marked with crimson
dots. Flesh, firm, crisp, juicy, and richly flavored.

An excellent and useful apple either for culinary purposes or dessert
use; it is in season from December to February.

The tree is a free grower and an excellent bearer; it attains above the
middle size, and may be grown either as an open dwarf, or an espalier,
when grafted on the paradise stock.


169. HARVEY’S WILTSHIRE DEFIANCE.--H.

[Illustration]

Fruit, of the largest size; conical, and very handsomely shaped,
distinctly five-sided, having five prominent and acute angles
descending from the apex, till they are lost in the base. Skin, fine
deep sulphur yellow; of a deeper shade on the side which is exposed
to the sun, and covered all over with minute russety dots, with here
and there ramifying patches of russet. Eye, pretty large and open,
with short ragged segments, and set in a rather shallow and angular
basin. Stalk, very short, about half-an-inch long, and not extending
beyond the base, inserted in a round and deep cavity, lined with rough
scaly russet, which branches out over a portion of the base. Flesh,
yellowish, firm, crisp, and juicy, sugary, vinous, and richly flavored.
Core, very small for the size of the apple.

A very handsome and most desirable apple, being of first-rate quality,
either as a dessert or culinary fruit; it is in use from the end of
October to the beginning of January.

This variety seems to be comparatively little known; but it is well
deserving the notice either of the fruit gardener, or the orchardist;
to the latter particularly so, as its size, fine appearance, and
handsome shape make it attractive at market; and its solid and weighty
flesh give it an advantage over many apples of its size.

shining, green at first, but changing to yellow as it ripens, and with
a faint tinge of red on the side exposed to the sun. Eye, half open,
with long acuminate segments, set in a deep and angular basin. Stalk,
half-an-inch long, inserted in a deep and irregular cavity. Flesh,
greenish-white, tender, juicy, sugary, rich, brisk, and aromatic.

An excellent dessert apple of first-rate quality when grown to
perfection; it is in use from January to May.

This is a variety of the Reinette Grise, and a very old French apple.

Fruit, varying very much in size, according to the situation and
condition of the tree; sometimes it is very large, and again scarcely
attaining the middle size; generally, however, it is above the medium
size; roundish and depressed, with occasionally a prominent rib on one
side, which gives it an irregularity in its appearance. Skin, smooth,
covered with a delicate bloom; greenish-yellow, with a blush of red on
one side, which varies in extent and depth of color according as it has
been more or less exposed to the sun. Eye, small and closed, with broad
and flat segments, placed in a pretty deep and irregular basin. Stalk,
short, stout, and sometimes fleshy, inserted in a deep and irregular
cavity. Flesh, white, crisp, and tender, very juicy, with an agreeable
and pleasant flavor.

One of the most valuable and popular apples in cultivation. It is
suitable only for kitchen use, and is in season from October to
December.

The tree is very healthy and vigorous, and as an early and abundant
bearer is unrivalled by any other variety. It succeeds well in almost
every description of soil and situation where it is possible for apples
to grow.

This variety was raised at Hawthornden, a romantic spot near Edinburgh,
celebrated as the birthplace and residence of Drummond the poet,
who was born there in 1585. I have never learnt at what period the
Hawthornden was first discovered. The first mention of it is in the
catalogue of Leslie and Anderson, of Edinburgh; but I do not think
it was known about London till 1790, when it was introduced to the
Brompton Park nursery.


172. HERMANN’S PIPPIN.--H.

 SYNONYME.--Grosser Gestreifter Hermannsapfel, _Diel Kernobst._ vii. 99?

Fruit, above medium size, three inches broad, and the same in height;
roundish, and irregularly formed. Skin, yellow, tinged with green on
the shaded side; but striped and mottled with dark crimson on the side
next the sun, and thickly strewed with russety dots round the eye. Eye,
open, with long green acuminate segments, which are recurved at the
tips, and set in a deep and slightly plaited basin. Stalk, short and
stout, inserted in a round, deep, and even cavity, which is lined with
rough grey russet, extending over almost the whole of the base. Flesh,
yellowish-white, very tender and juicy, but with little flavor.

An apple of very ordinary quality, which seems only suitable for
culinary purposes; it is in use from October to January.

I received this variety from Mr. James Lake, of Bridgewater, and it
seems to be so like the description of Diel’s Grosser Gestreifter
Hermannsapfel, that I have adopted it as a synonyme.

broad broken stripes of bright crimson on the side next the sun; the
whole surface entirely covered with a thick bloom, like thin hoar
frost. Eye, very small, set in a shallow and plaited basin. Stalk,
short, inserted in a wide and round cavity. Flesh, yellowish-white,
tinged with red at the surface under the skin, brisk, juicy, rich, and
slightly acid.

A beautiful and very good culinary apple, of second-rate quality; it is
in use from October to December.

angles or ribs extending from the base to the apex. Skin, deep yellow,
tinged with green on the shaded side; but bright deep scarlet where
exposed to the sun, generally extending over the whole surface. Eye,
closed, with long acuminate segments, and set in a wide and deep basin.
Stalk, short and slender, inserted in a deep funnel-shaped cavity,
which is generally lined with russet. Flesh, white, with a slight tinge
of green, delicate, tender and juicy, with a brisk and pleasant flavor.

A beautiful and showy apple for culinary purposes, but not of
first-rate quality; it is in use from October to Christmas.

The tree is a strong and vigorous grower, but not a very abundant
bearer. It succeeds well on the paradise stock.

strewed with large green dots. Eye, small and closed, set in a round,
narrow, and plaited basin. Stalk, very short, embedded in a wide and
deep cavity. Flesh, yellowish-white, firm, tender, juicy, sugary, and
briskly acid.

A valuable apple, of first-rate quality for culinary purposes; it is in
use from November to March.

The tree is a strong grower, vigorous, healthy, and a good bearer.

This is the Holland Pippin of Langley and Miller, but not of Ray or
Ralph Austen, who make it synonymous with the Kirton Pippin, which
Ray describes as being small and oblate, and the same as is called
Broad-eye in Sussex. The Holland Pippin is a native of the Holland
district of Lincolnshire, hence its name.


176. HOLLOW CORE.--H.

[Illustration]

Fruit, medium sized, two inches and a half wide, and three inches high;
conical, irregular in its outline, ribbed, and distinctly four-sided;
at about four-fifths of its length towards the crown it is very much
contracted and swells out again towards the eye, altogether very much
resembling a codlin in shape. Skin, smooth and shining, pale grass
green on the shaded side, and covered with a cloud of pale red next
the sun, thinly strewed with dots, which are red on the exposed, and
dark green on the shaded side. Eye, small and closed, set in a narrow,
contracted, and plaited basin, which is surrounded with several small
knobs. Stalk, green and downy, half-an-inch long, inserted in a narrow,
close, and deep basin, which is quite smooth. Flesh, white, very tender
and delicate, with a brisk, mild, and pleasant flavor. Core, very
large, with open cells.

An excellent culinary apple, with a fine perfume; ripe in September.

This variety is extensively grown in Berkshire, particularly about
Newbury and Reading, whence large quantities are sent to London for the
supply of Covent Garden Market.

base, and slightly angular on the sides. Skin, pale green, becoming
yellow at maturity, with a faint blush of red where it is exposed to
the sun. Eye, large, and set in a wide and deep basin. Stalk, short,
thick, and curved, inserted in a rather deep cavity. Flesh, firm,
juicy, sugary, and briskly acid.

An excellent culinary apple; in use from November to February.


178. HOOD’S SEEDLING.--Ronalds.

 IDENTIFICATION AND FIGURE.--Ron. Pyr. Mal. pl. xxiii. f. 5.

This appears to me to be identical with the Scarlet Pearmain. The
fruit is exactly the same, and not distinguishable from it. The only
difference I can detect is, that the young trees are more strong and
vigorous than that variety; but the distinction is altogether so
slight, that if not really identical, they are so similar as not to
require separate descriptions.

uniform clear yellow, strewed with brown russety dots. Eye, large and
closed, with long segments, and set in a shallow and uneven basin.
Stalk, very short and stout, deeply inserted. Flesh, white, tender,
very juicy, and pleasantly acid.

An excellent apple, of first-rate quality for culinary use, and
suitable also for the dessert; it is in season from October to March.


180. HORSHAM RUSSET.--Lind.

 IDENTIFICATION.--Lind. in Hort. Trans. vol. iv. p. 69. Lind. Guide, 89.

Fruit, about the size of the Nonpareil, but not so regular in its
outline, generally about two inches and a quarter in diameter, and
two inches deep. Eye, small and closed, in a small depression without
angles. Stalk, short, rather thick, rather deeply inserted in a wide,
uneven cavity. Skin, pale green, covered with a thin, yellowish-grey
russet round its upper part, with a pale salmon-colored tinge on the
sunny side. Flesh, greenish-white, firm, crisp. Juice, plentiful, of a
high aromatic Nonpareil flavor.

A dessert apple; in season from November till March.

Raised from the seed of a Nonpareil about thirty years ago (1821), by
Mrs. Goose, of Horsham St. Faith’s, near Norwich. It is a very hardy
tree, and a good bearer.

yellowish-green, and marked with broad streaks of pale red, on the side
next the sun, which is strewed with rather large russety freckles. Eye,
small and open, with erect, acute segments, and placed in a rather
deep, narrow, and undulating basin. Stalk, short, inserted in a round,
funnel-shaped cavity, which is lined with pale brown russet. Flesh,
white, tender, crisp, and juicy, with a brisk and pleasant flavor.

[Illustration]

Fruit, small; ovate, and regularly formed. Skin, covered with pale
brown russet, and where any portion of the ground color is exposed,
it is yellowish-green on the shaded side, and brownish-red next the
sun; but sometimes it is almost free from russet, particularly in hot
seasons, being then of an uniform yellowish-green, mottled with orange
or pale red next the sun. Eye, small and closed, with short segments,
and set in a shallow basin. Stalk, short, about half-an-inch long,
inserted in a round and even cavity. Flesh, yellow, firm, not juicy,
but very rich, sugary, and highly aromatic.

This is one of the richest flavored dessert apples; it is in use from
November to April.

The tree is a small grower, but healthy, hardy, and an abundant bearer.

Hubbard’s Pearmain was first introduced to public notice by Mr. George
Lindley, at a meeting of the London Horticultural Society in 1820.
“This,” says Mr. Lindley, “is a real Norfolk apple, well known in the
Norwich market; and although it may be found elsewhere, its great
excellence may have caused its removal hence. The merits of Hubbard’s
Pearmain as a table apple are unrivalled, and its superior, from the
commencement of its season to the end, does not, I am of opinion, exist
in this country.”

covered with large, green, and russety dots, which are thickest round
the eye. Eye, open, with short, flat, acuminate segments, which are
generally reflexed at the tips, and set in a wide, shallow, and plaited
basin. Stalk, very short, and not at all depressed, being sometimes
like a small knob on the flattened base. Flesh, yellowish-white, firm,
rich, brisk, juicy, sugary, and aromatic.

A dessert apple of first-rate quality; in use from December to February.

The tree is hardy, and healthy, though not a strong grower, the shoots
being long and slender. It is also an excellent bearer.


183. HUNT’S DEUX ANS.--Hort.

 IDENTIFICATION.--Hort. Soc. Cat. ed. 3, n. 201.

Fruit, medium sized, two inches and three quarters wide, by two inches
and a half high; somewhat conical, irregularly formed, and angular.
Skin, greenish, and covered with grey russet on the shaded side; but
redish-brown covered with grey russet, and large russety dots, on the
side exposed to the sun. Eye, large, and open, with long, spreading,
acuminate segments, placed in a deep, angular, and irregular basin.
Stalk, half-an-inch long, inserted in a deep, oblique cavity, and not
extending beyond the base. Flesh, yellowish-white tinged with green,
firm and leathery, juicy and sugary, with a rich and highly aromatic
flavor, very similar to, and little inferior to the Ribston Pippin.

A dessert apple of the first quality, whether as regards its long
duration, or the peculiar richness of its flavor: it is in use from
December to March; but according to Mr. Thompson--no mean authority--it
will keep for two years. It may, however, be a question whether or
not this is identical with the Hunt’s Deux Ans of the Horticultural
Society, which Mr. Thompson regards as only a second-rate fruit. If it
is the same, the climate of Somersetshire, whence I had both trees and
specimens of the fruit, is more adapted for bringing it to perfection
than that of Chiswick.

with thin russet, except a spot on the shaded side, where it is green;
and where exposed to the sun it is of a redish-brown. Flesh, white
tinged with green, crisp, juicy, and highly flavored.

A dessert apple of first-rate quality; in use from December to February.

This variety was raised from a seed of the old Nonpareil, to which it
bears a strong resemblance, by Dr. Fry of Gloucester, and received the
name it now bears, from being sent to the Horticultural Society of
London, by Thomas Hunt Esq., of Stratford-on-Avon, in 1820. Mr. Lindley
gives Hunt’s Nonpariel as a synonyme of Duke of Gloucester; but it is a
very distinct variety; it was, however, a seedling raised by Mr. Hunt
from the Duke of Gloucester, and is a very first-rate variety.


185. HUNTHOUSE.--Hort.

 IDENTIFICATION.--Hort. Soc. Cat. ed. 3, n. 347. Rog. Fr. Cult. 57.

Fruit, of medium size, two inches and three quarters wide, by two
inches and a half high; conical, ribbed on the sides, and terminated at
the apex, with rather prominent knobs. Skin, at first grass-green, but
changing as it ripens to greenish-yellow; where exposed to the sun it
is tinged with red, and marked with small crimson dots and a few short
broken streaks of the same color; but where shaded it is veined with
thin brown russet, particularly about the eye, and very thinly strewed
with russety dots. Eye, large, half open, with broad flat segments, set
in a narrow, and deeply furrowed basin. Stalk, an inch long, straight,
inserted in a very shallow cavity, sometimes between two fleshy lips,
but generally with a fleshy protuberance on one side of it. Flesh,
greenish-white, firm, tender, and with a brisk, but rather coarse and
rough acid flavor.

A useful culinary apple; in use from December to March.

Its chief recommendation is, the immense productiveness of the tree,
which is rather small, with pendulous shoots, and extremely hardy; it
succeeds in exposed situations where many other varieties could not
grow. Rogers says, “it is a tree of the third class in the orchard,
and will answer well in exposed situations, trained as dwarfs or
half-standards, it being equal in hardihood, and very fit to be planted
along with the Grey Leadington.”

This variety was discovered at Whitby, in Yorkshire, where it is
extensively cultivated.


186. HUTTON SQUARE.--H.

[Illustration]

Fruit, large; roundish-ovate, and irregular in its outline, being much
bossed on the sides, and knobbed about the eye and the stalk. Skin,
smooth, dull greenish-yellow where shaded, and strewed with minute
russety dots; but washed with dull red next the sun, and dotted with
black dots. Eye, small and closed, placed in an angular and plaited
basin. Stalk, short, deeply embedded in an angular cavity. Flesh,
white, firm, crisp, sweet, briskly and pleasantly flavored.

A valuable culinary apple of first-rate quality, and not unsuitable for
the dessert, where a brisk and poignant flavored apple is preferred; it
is in use from November to March.

This variety is extensively grown about Lancaster; and is said to have
originated at the village of Hutton, in that vicinity.

The tree is an excellent bearer.


187. IRISH PEACH.--Hort.

 IDENTIFICATION.--Hort. Soc. Cat. ed. 3, n. 527. Lind. Guide, 4. Down.

 FIGURES.--Pom. Mag. t. 100. Ron. Pyr. Mal. pl. viii. f. 1.

Fruit, medium sized, two inches and three quarters wide, by two inches
and a quarter high; roundish, somewhat flattened, and slightly angular.
Skin, smooth, pale yellowish-green, tinged with dull redish-brown, and
thickly dotted with green dots on the shaded side; but fine lively red,
mottled and speckled with yellow spots on the side exposed to the sun.
Eye, small and closed, set in a rather deep, and knobbed basin, which
is lined with thick tomentum. Stalk, short, thick, and fleshy, inserted
in a pretty deep cavity. Flesh, greenish-white, tender, and crisp,
abounding in a rich, brisk, vinous, and aromatic juice, which, at this
season, is particularly refreshing.

An early dessert apple of the finest quality. It is ripe during the
first week in August, and lasts all through that month. It is a most
beautiful, and certainly one of the most excellent summer apples,
possessing all the rich flavor of some of the winter varieties, with
the abundant and refreshing juice of the summer fruits. Like most of
the summer apples it is in greatest perfection when eaten from the
tree, which is hardy, vigorous, and an abundant bearer.


188. IRISH REINETTE.--H.

Fruit, medium sized, two inches and three quarters wide, by two
inches and a half high; oblong, somewhat five-sided, with five ribs
which extend from the base to the apex, where they run into the eye,
forming five prominent ridges. Skin, yellowish-green, strewed with
minute russety dots on the shaded side; but dull brownish-red, almost
entirely covered with large patches of dull leaden colored russet, on
the side exposed to the sun. Eye, small and closed, placed in a ribbed
and plaited basin. Stalk, short, inserted in a round, deep, and even
cavity. Flesh, greenish-yellow, firm, crisp, and very juicy, with a
brisk, and poignant acid juice.

A valuable culinary apple; in use from November to February.

This variety is much cultivated about Lancaster, and in the county of
Westmoreland, where it is highly esteemed.

 FIGURES.--Ron. Pyr. Mal. pl. xxxii. f. 4. Pom. Heref. t. 8.

Fruit, small, two inches wide, by an inch and a half deep; globular.
Eye, slightly sunk, with broad acute segments of the calyx. Stalk, very
short. Skin, yellowish-golden grey, with a russety epidermis, highly
colored with orange and red next the sun. Flesh, firm and juicy, with a
rich and aromatic flavor.

A dessert apple of first-rate quality, and also valuable as a cider
fruit; it is in use from September to January.

The specific gravity of its juice is 1074.

This is a very old variety, and is no doubt the “Orange Apple” of Ray
and Worlidge. According to Mr. Knight, it is by some supposed to have
been introduced from Normandy to the Isle of Wight, where it was first
planted in the garden at Wrexall Cottage, near the Undercliff, where it
was growing in 1817. There are several other varieties of apples known
by the name of “Orange” and “Orange Pippin,” but they are all very
inferior to this.

The tree does not attain a large size, but is hardy, healthy, and an
excellent bearer. It succeeds well when grafted on the paradise stock,
and grown as an open dwarf, or an espalier.


190. ISLEWORTH CRAB.--Hort.

 SYNONYME.--Brentford Crab, _acc. Hort. Soc. Cat._ ed. 3, p. 21.

Fruit, medium sized, two inches and three quarters wide, by the same in
height; conical. Skin, smooth, of a pale yellow color, with a deeper
tinge where exposed to the sun, and covered with small redish-brown
dots. Eye, small and open, with reflexed segments, set in a round and
narrow basin. Stalk, slender, inserted in a deep, round, and even
cavity. Flesh, yellowish-white, crisp, sweet, juicy, and pleasantly
flavored.

A pretty good culinary apple of second-rate quality; in use during
October; but scarcely worth cultivation.

[Illustration]

Fruit, small; round, and a little flattened. Skin, smooth and shining,
pale yellowish-green in the shade; but clear yellow, with sometimes
a faint tinge of red or orange next the sun. Eye, small and closed,
surrounded with a few small plaits, and set in a very shallow basin.
Stalk, an inch long, slender, and inserted in a shallow cavity, which
is lined with delicate russet. Flesh, white, crisp, brisk, and juicy,
with a vinous and slightly perfumed flavor, but becoming meally and
tasteless, if kept only a few days after being gathered.

This is the earliest apple of the year, the first of Pomona’s autumnal
offerings; it is in greatest perfection when gathered off the tree, or
immediately afterwards, as it very soon becomes dry and meally.

The tree does not attain a large size, but is hardy and healthy. It is
not a great bearer, which may, in a great measure, account for it not
being so generally cultivated, as its earliness would recommend it to
be. If worked on the paradise stock it may be grown in pots, when the
fruit will not only be produced earlier, but in greater abundance than
on the crab, or free stock.

This is one of our oldest apples, and although generally known and
popular, seems to have escaped the notice of Miller, who does not
even mention it in any of the editions of his dictionary. As I have
doubts of this being the Geneting of Parkinson--his figure being
evidently intended for the Margaret, which in some districts is called
Joanneting--the first mention we have of this variety is by Rea, in
1665, who describes it as “a small, yellow, red-sided apple, upon a
wall, ripe in the end of June.”

The orthography which I have adopted in the nomenclature of this apple
may, to some, at first sight, seem strange; but I am nevertheless
persuaded it is the correct one. The different forms in which it has
been written will be found in the synonymes given above, none of which
afford any assistance as to the derivation or signification of the
name. Abercrombie was the first who wrote it June-eating, as if in
allusion to the period of its maturity, which is, however, not till the
end of July. Dr. Johnson, in his Dictionary, writes it Gineting, and
says it is a corruption of Janeton (_Fr._) signifying Jane or Janet,
having been so called from a person of that name. Ray[K] says, “Pomum
Ginettinum, quod unde dictum sit me latet.” Indeed there does not seem
ever to have been a correct definition given of it.

In the middle ages, it was customary to make the festivals of the
church, or saint’s days, periods on which occurrences were to take
place, or from which events were dated. Even in the present day, we
hear the country people talking of some crop to be sown, or some other
to be planted at Michaelmas, St. Martin’s, or Saint Andrew’s-tide. It
was also the practice, during the reign of Popery in this country,
as is still the case in all Roman Catholic countries, for parents to
dedicate their children to some particular saint, as Jean Baptiste,
on the recurrence of whose festival, all who are so named keep it as
a holiday. So it was also in regard to fruits, which were named after
the day about which they came to maturity. Thus, we have the Margaret
Apple, so called from being ripe about St. Margaret’s day--the 20th of
July. The Magdalene, or Maudlin, from St. Magdalene’s day--the 22nd of
July. And in Curtius[L] we find the _Joannina_, so called, “Quod circa
divi Joannis Baptistæ nativitatem esui sint.” These are also noticed
by J. B. Porta; he says, “Est genus alterum quod quia circa festum
Divi Joannis maturiscit, vulgus _Melo de San Giovanni_ dicitur.” And
according to Tragus,[M] “Quæ apud nos prima maturantur, Sanct Johans
Öpffel, Latine, Præcocia mala dicuntur.”

We see, therefore, that they were called Joannina, because they ripened
about St. John’s Day. We have also among the old French pears Amiré
Joannet--the Admired, or Wonderful Little John, which Merlet informs us
was so called, because it ripened about St. John’s Day. If then we add
to Joannet the termination _ing_, so general among our names of apples,
we have _Joanneting_. There can be no doubt that this is the correct
derivation, and signification of the name of this apple, and although
the orthography may for a time appear singular, it will in the course
of usage become as familiar as the other forms in which it as been
written.

192. KEEPING RED-STREAK.--Hort.

 IDENTIFICATION.--Hort. Soc. Cat. ed. 3, n. 627.

Fruit, medium sized; roundish, flattened, angular on the sides. Skin,
green at first, changing to greenish-yellow, and striped with red on
the shaded side; but entirely covered with dark red on the side next
the sun, marked with russet, and numerous grey dots. Eye, open, set in
a shallow and undulating basin. Stalk, very short, imbedded in a narrow
and shallow cavity. Flesh, greenish-yellow, firm, brisk, and pleasantly
flavored.

A culinary apple; in use from December to April.


193. KEEPING RUSSET.--H.

Fruit, medium sized, two inches and five eighths wide, and two inches
and a quarter high; roundish. Skin, entirely covered with thin, pale
yellowish-brown russet, like the Golden Russet, and occasionally with a
bright, varnished, fiery-red cheek on the side next the sun, which is
sometimes more distinct than at others. Eye, open, set in a round and
plaited basin. Stalk, very short, imbedded in a rather shallow cavity.
Flesh, yellow, firm, juicy, and sugary, with a particularly rich,
mellow flavor, equal to, and even surpassing that of the Ribston Pippin.

A delicious dessert apple, of first-rate quality: in use from October
to January, and, under favorable circumstances, will even keep till
March.

This is an apple which is very little known, and does not seem at all
to be in general cultivation. I obtained it from the private garden of
the late Mr. James Lee, at Hammersmith. It certainly deserves greater
publicity.

high; roundish, irregular, and slightly ribbed. Skin, smooth,
yellowish-green in the shade, and pale yellow with a redish-brown
blush, which is streaked with deeper red, on the side next the sun.
Eye, large, set in a wide and irregular basin. Flesh, tender and juicy,
with a brisk and pleasant flavor.

This is an excellent culinary apple, of first-rate quality, in use from
November to January.

The tree is a strong and vigorous grower, attaining a large size, and
is an abundant bearer.

This is not the Kentish Fill-basket of Miller and Forsyth, nor yet of
Rogers; the variety described under this name by these writers being
evidently the Kentish Codlin.

yellow, with brownish-red next the sun, studded with specks, which are
greenish on the shaded side, but yellowish next the sun. Eye, small,
and partially open, set in a wide, shallow, and plaited basin. Stalk,
very short and fleshy, almost imbedded in a deep and wide cavity,
which is smooth or rarely marked with russet. Flesh, yellowish-white,
delicate, very juicy, with a sweet, and briskly acid flavor.

A culinary apple of first-rate quality; in use from October to January.

The tree attains a pretty good size, is hardy, vigorous, and a good
bearer.

This is a very old and favorite apple, first mentioned by Ray, and
enumerated in the list of Leonard Meager, as one of the varieties
then cultivated in the London nurseries, in 1670. Mortimer made a sad
lamentation on the fancied degeneration of the Kentish Pippin, which I
have quoted in treating of the Golden Pippin.

Fruit, below medium size; oval, sometimes roundish-oval. Skin, smooth
and shining, greenish-yellow at first, but changing as it ripens to a
fine clear pale yellow color, tinged and streaked with red, on the side
next the sun; but sometimes when fully exposed, one half of the surface
is covered with bright shining crimson, streaked with deeper crimson;
it is marked on the shaded side with some traces of delicate russet.
Eye, small and closed, with broad, erect, and acuminate segments, set
in a shallow basin, which is generally surrounded with five prominent
plaits. Stalk, slender, three quarters of an inch long, obliquely
inserted in a small cavity, by the side of a fleshy protuberance.
Flesh, yellowish-white, firm, crisp, and very juicy, with a rich,
sugary, brisk, and aromatic flavor.

An early dessert apple of the highest excellence; It is in use during
September and October.

The tree is a free grower, hardy, and a good bearer, attaining about
the middle size. It is well adapted for grafting on the paradise stock,
and being grown either as a dwarf, or espalier.

This variety was introduced chiefly through the instrumentality of Mr.
Robertson, the nurseryman of Kilkenny, in Ireland.

 Fr. Amer. 87. Rog. Fr. Cult. 65.

 FIGURE.--Ron. Pyr. Mal. pl. iii. f. 3.

Fruit, large; conical and angular. Skin, pale yellow, with a blush on
the side exposed to the sun. Eye, large, set in a deep and angular
basin. Stalk, short, inserted in a deep cavity. Flesh, pale yellow,
very juicy, and briskly flavored.

One of the earliest, and most valuable of our culinary apples. It
may be used for tarts so early as the end of June; but its greatest
perfection is during August and September.

The tree is healthy, vigorous, and an immense bearer, attaining to the
middle size. It succeeds well in almost every soil and situation, and
when grown on the paradise stock, is well suited for espalier training.

This excellent apple was first discovered, growing among a quantity of
rubbish, behind a wall at Gleaston Castle, near Ulverstone, and was
first brought into notice by one John Sander, a nurseryman at Keswick,
who having propagated it, sent it out under the name of Keswick Codlin.

In the Memoirs of the Caledonian Horticultural Society, Sir John
Sinclair says, “the Keswick Codlin tree has never failed to bear a crop
since it was planted in the Episcopal garden at Rose Castle, Carlisle,
twenty years ago (1813). It is an apple of fine tartness and flavor,
and may be used early in autumn. The tree is a very copious bearer,
and the fruit is of good size, considerably larger than the Carlisle
Codlin. It flourishes best in a strong soil.”


198. KILKENNY PEARMAIN.--Hort.

 IDENTIFICATION.--Hort. Soc. Cat. ed. 3, n. 547.

Fruit, below medium size, two inches and a half wide, and the same
in height; roundish, inclining to conical. Skin, yellow, sprinkled
with russety dots, and sometimes covered with slight reticulations
of russet; tinged with orange, and a few streaks of red, on the side
exposed to the sun. Eye, small, and rather open, set in a narrow basin.
Stalk, short, inserted in a shallow cavity, and surrounded with a large
patch of russet. Flesh, yellowish, crisp, tender, juicy, and sweet; but
of dry texture, and lacking acidity.

A dessert apple of no great merit; in use from October to Christmas.


199. KING OF THE PIPPINS.--H.

[Illustration]

Fruit, medium sized; ovate or conical, regularly and handsomely shaped.
Skin, greenish yellow, with a blush of red next the sun, and marked
with a little rough brown russet. Eye, large, and partially open, with
long and broad segments, which are connivent, but reflexed at the tips,
set in a shallow and undulating basin. Stalk, a quarter of an inch
long, just extending beyond the base. Flesh, white with a yellowish
tinge, firm, crisp, very juicy and sugary, with a rich vinous flavor.

This is one of the richest flavored early dessert apples, and
unequalled by any other variety of the same season; it is ripe in the
end of August, and beginning of September.

This is the original, and true King of the Pippins, and a very
different apple from that generally known by the same name. _See_
Golden Winter Pearmain. I suspect this is the _King Apple_ of Rea.


200. KINGSTON BLACK.--Hort.

 IDENTIFICATION.--Hort. Soc. Cat. ed. 3.

Fruit, small, two inches and a quarter wide, and one and three quarters
high; roundish. Skin, pale yellow, striped with red on the shaded side;
and very dark red, striped with dark purple, or almost black stripes,
on the side next the sun; thickly strewed all over with light-grey
russety dots, and with a large patch of russet over the base. Eye,
open, with broad reflexed segments, and set in a deep basin. Stalk,
very short, inserted in a shallow cavity. Flesh, white, stained with
red under the skin, on the side next the sun, tender, juicy, sweet, and
pleasantly flavored.

This is a beautiful little apple, extensively grown in Somersetshire,
where in the present day it is considered the most valuable cider
apple. It keeps till Christmas.


201. KIRKE’S LORD NELSON.--Hort.

 IDENTIFICATION.--Hort. Soc. Cat. ed. 3, n. 414.

 FIGURE.--Ron. Pyr. Mal. pl. xiv.

Fruit, large, three inches and a quarter wide, and two inches and
three quarters high; roundish, and narrowing a little towards the
apex. Skin, smooth, pale yellow, streaked all over with red. Eye, open,
with short reflexed segments, and set in a plaited basin. Stalk, short
and slender. Flesh, yellowish-white, firm, juicy and aromatic, but
wants acidity.

An inferior variety, neither a good dessert apple, nor at all suitable
for culinary purposes; It is in use from November to February.

being covered with numerous knobs, or large warts, some of which are
the size of peas. Skin, greenish-yellow, and covered with thick scaly
russet. Eye, set in a deep basin. Stalk, inserted in a deep cavity.
Flesh, yellowish, crisp, sweet, and highly flavored; but not very juicy.

A singular looking dessert apple, of first-rate quality. It is in use
from December to March.

This variety was introduced to the notice of the London Horticultural
Society in 1819, by Mr. Haslar Capron, of Midhurst, in Sussex.


203. LADY’S DELIGHT.--H.

Fruit, medium sized, three inches wide, and two inches and a quarter
high; oblate, and ribbed on the sides. Skin, smooth and shining,
greenish-yellow, marked with a number of imbedded dark-green specks;
washed with red on the side next the sun, and with a circle of red rays
round the base. Eye, partially closed, with broad and flat segments;
set in an angular and plaited basin. Stalk, short and slender, inserted
in a round and rather deep cavity. Flesh, white, tender, crisp, very
juicy, sweet, brisk, and pleasantly aromatic.

An excellent culinary or dessert apple, highly esteemed about
Lancaster, where it is much grown; it is in use from October to
Christmas.

The habit of the tree is drooping, like that of the Weeping Willow.


204. LADY’S FINGER.--Fors.

 IDENTIFICATION.--Fors. Treat. 111.

Fruit, below medium size, two inches and a quarter wide, and two inches

five sided, flattened at the apex, where it is terminated in five
prominent knobs, with a smaller one between each. Skin, smooth, dull
greenish-yellow, strewed with minute, grey russety dots; tinged on the
side next the sun with a dull blush, which is interspersed with spots
of deep lively red. Eye, small and partially closed, set in a small
and regularly notched basin. Stalk, slender, short, and obliquely
inserted under a fleshy protuberance. Flesh, yellow, tender, juicy, and
pleasantly acid.

A culinary apple much grown about Lancaster; it is in use from
November, to March or April.

This is a very different apple from the _White Paradise_, which is
sometimes called “The Lady’s Finger.”

Fruit, small; roundish or oblato-oblong, regularly and handsomely
shaped. Skin, smooth greenish-yellow on the shaded side, but becoming
clear yellow when at maturity; on the side next the sun it is dull
orange, streaked and striped with red, which becomes more faint as it
extends to the shaded side, and dotted all over with minute, punctured,
russety dots. Eye, rather large, and open, with long, broad segments,
reflexed at the tips, and set in a wide, deep and plaited basin. Stalk,
from a quarter to half-an-inch long, slender, deeply inserted in a
russety cavity. Flesh, yellowish-white, firm, crisp, very juicy and
sugary, with a brisk, and rich vinous flavor.

A dessert apple of first-rate quality, and very valuable, both as
regards the richness of its flavor, and the long period to which it
remains in perfection; it is in use from January, and keeps till April
without shrivelling.

The tree is healthy, a free grower, and good bearer.

This variety was raised in the year 1804, by the wife of Neil Malcolm
Esq. of Lamb Abbey, near Dartford in Kent, from the pip of an imported
fruit of the Newtown Pippin.

which is frequently higher on one side than the other. Stalk, short,
entirely covered with a fleshy elongation of the fruit. Flesh, firm,
crisp, and briskly flavored.

A very good apple, either for culinary or dessert use; it is in season
from October to April, and is perhaps the most characteristic apple we
have, being sometimes so much like a lemon, as at first sight to be
taken for that fruit. Forsyth says it is excellent for drying.

The tree does not attain a large size; but is healthy, hardy, and a
good bearer.

It is uncertain at what period the Lemon Pippin was first brought
into notice. Rogers calls it the “Quince Apple,” and, if it is what
has always been known under that name, it must be of considerable
antiquity, being mentioned by Rea, Worlidge, Ray, and almost all the
early writers; but the first instance wherein we find it called Lemon
Pippin, is in Ellis’s “Modern Husbandman” 1744, where he says it is
“esteemed so good an apple for all uses, that many plant this tree
preferable to all others.”

 FIGURE.--Ron. Pyr. Mal. pl. xxx. f 2.

Fruit, large, three inches wide and two inches and three quarters high;
conical, broad at the base and narrow at the apex, which is generally
higher on one side than the other. Skin, deep lively red, streaked with
crimson on the side next the sun; but yellow, faintly streaked with

dots. Eye, small and open, with broad, and slightly connivent segments,
set in a rather narrow, and somewhat angular basin. Stalk, very short,
inserted in a wide, and deep cavity, which is lined with thin grey
russet. Flesh, yellowish, firm, crisp, and juicy, with a brisk and
slightly perfumed flavor.

A useful apple either for culinary purposes or the dessert but only of
second-rate quality; it is in use from December to February.

The tree attains the largest size, is strong, vigorous, and an abundant
bearer.

Fruit, medium sized, two inches and three quarters broad, and two
inches and a quarter high; roundish, and flattened, with a few ribs on
the sides which increase in size towards the crown where they terminate
in five prominent and equal ridges, from which circumstance it has been
called the Five-Crowned Pippin. Skin, at first pale yellowish-green,
changing to pale yellow or lemon color, with brownish-red on the
side next the sun. Eye, small and closed, set in a rather shallow
basin. Stalk, half an inch long, slender, and deeply inserted. Flesh,
yellowish-white, firm, crisp, tender, and juicy, with a brisk and
pleasant flavor.

An excellent culinary apple, and serviceable also for the dessert; it
is in use from November to April, when it is perfectly sound and shows
no symptoms of shrivelling.

The tree attains about the middle size, is not a strong grower, but
quite hardy, and an excellent bearer.

Although there is no record of this variety in the writings of any
pomological author before Mr. Lindley, it is nevertheless a very old
English apple. In an ancient note-book of an ancestor of Sir John
Trevelyan, Bart., of Nettlecombe, in Somersetshire, so early as 1580,
the “Lounden Peppen” is mentioned among the “names of Apelles which I
had their graffes from Brentmarch, from one Mr. Pace.” From this we
may learn, that we are not to take for granted the non-existence of
any variety, simply because there is no notice of it, previous to the
period when it may have been first recorded, in works on pomology.


212. LONG NOSE.--H.

Fruit, rather below medium size, two inches and a half high, and about
the same in width at the base; conical, with prominent angles on the
sides. Skin, smooth and shining, grass green, changing to greenish
yellow, with a cloud of bright red on the side exposed to the sun.
Eye, closed, set in a shallow basin. Stalk, a quarter of an inch long,
fleshy at the insertion, sometimes with a fleshy protuberance on one
side of it, and inserted in a narrow, shallow, and russety cavity.
Flesh, yellowish-white, crisp, and tender, with a slightly sweet but
rather indifferent flavor.

An apple of little merit, being of no value either for culinary
purposes or the dessert; it is in season from October to December, and
is met with in the Berkshire Orchards.


213. LONGSTART. H.

 SYNONYME.--Westmoreland Longstart.

Fruit, medium sized; roundish, narrowing towards the eye, somewhat
like the old Nonpareil in shape. Skin, almost entirely covered with
red, which is streaked with deeper red; except on the shaded side
where there is a patch of greenish-yellow, tinged with thin red. Eye,
partially open, with broad, flat segments, and set in a shallow and
plaited basin. Stalk, about an inch long, inserted in a wide cavity,
which is lined with russet. Flesh, white, crisp, tender, juicy, with a
pleasant sub-acid flavor.

A very excellent culinary apple; comes into use during October, and
lasts till Christmas.

This variety is much grown about Lancaster, and some parts of
Westmoreland, where it is a great favorite among the cottagers.

the side next the sun. Eye, small and open, with short erect segments,
set in a deep and plaited basin. Stalk, short, and deeply inserted.
Flesh, yellow, firm, sweet, slightly acid, and with a perfumed flavor.

A dessert apple, of good, but only second-rate quality; in use during
August and September.

According to Mr. Lindley “It is said that this apple was originated
in Herefordshire, where it is at present but little known: it is very
handsome, and of considerable merit.”

in a narrow, and shallow cavity. Flesh, yellowish-white, tender and
delicate, juicy and sugary, with a rich aromatic flavor, resembling
that of a pine apple.

A dessert apple of first-rate quality; it is in use from the beginning

short and thick, inserted in a rather deep cavity. Flesh, white, firm,
juicy, and pleasantly flavored.

A culinary apple of first-rate quality; in use from October to February.

The tree is a strong and vigorous grower, attains a large size, and is
an excellent and early bearer.

This variety as well as the preceeding was raised in the Exeter nursery.


217. MADELEINE.--Calvel.

 IDENTIFICATION.--Calvel. Traité. iii. 24.

 SYNONYMES.--Margaret, _Mill. Dict._ Summer Pippin, _acc. Hort. Soc.

Fruit, rather below medium size; roundish. Skin, yellowish-white, with
numerous imbedded pearly specks, with an orange tinge next the sun,
and sometimes marked with faint streaks of red. Eye, small and closed,
set in a narrow basin, and surrounded with several unequal plaits.
Stalk, short and slender, not extending beyond the base, and inserted
in a funnel-shaped cavity. Flesh, white, very crisp and tender, juicy,
sugary, and highly flavored.

An early dessert apple, of good, but only second-rate quality; ripe in
the middle and end of August.

The tree is a free grower, and is readily distinguished by the
excessive pubescence of its leaves and shoots.

Mr. Lindley in the “Guide to the Orchard” considers this variety as
identical with the Margaret of Ray, which is a mistake. It is no doubt
the Margaret of Miller, but certainly not of any English author either
preceeding, or subsequent to him. It is to be observed that the lists
of fruits given by Miller in his Dictionary are chiefly taken from the
works of the French pomologists, while the fruits of his own country
are almost wholly neglected; and the only reason I can assign for him
describing this variety for the Margaret is, because our own Margaret
being by some authors called the _Magdalene_, he might have thought the
two synonymous.--See Margaret.

color, tinged with a blush of beautiful red on the side exposed to the
sun. Eye, pretty large and closed, set in a round, even, and rather
deep basin, Stalk, short, inserted in a deep, and round cavity. Flesh,
white, tender, brisk, and pleasantly acid.

A very beautiful culinary apple, but not of first-rate quality. It is
in use during September and October.

The tree is a vigorous grower, and an abundant bearer.

This variety is of American origin. It is highly esteemed in the
neighbourhood of Philadelphia, and considered one of the best culinary
apples in America; it is also much used for drying, for which purpose
it is considered the best. It is not however held in great repute in
this country, its size and color being its chief recommendation.

Fruit, large; conical, and slightly angular. Skin, smooth,
greenish-yellow at first, but changing as it ripens to clear
pale-yellow, tinged with rich orange-red on the side next the sun;
but sometimes, when fully exposed, assuming a clear bright-red cheek.
Eye, small and closed, set in a small, plaited, and pretty deep basin.
Stalk, three quarters of an inch long, more or less fleshy, sometimes
straight, but generally obliquely inserted, and occasionally united
to the fruit by a fleshy protuberance on one side of it. Flesh,
yellowish-white, firm, brisk, juicy and slightly perfumed.

A very valuable early culinary apple, of first-rate quality. It is ripe
in the beginning of August, and continues in use till November.

The tree is very hardy, and healthy, but not a large grower. It is a
very early and abundant bearer, young trees in the nursery quarters
generally producing a considerable quantity of fruit, when only two
years old from the grafts. It is well suited for planting in exposed
situations, and succeeds well in shallow soils. It forms a beautiful
little tree when grafted on the paradise stock, and is well adapted for
espalier training.


220. MANNINGTON’S PEARMAIN.--H.

[Illustration]

Fruit, medium sized; abrupt pearmain-shaped. Skin, of a rich
golden-yellow color, covered with thin brown russet, on the shaded
side; but covered with dull brownish-red, on the side next the sun.
Eye, partially closed, with broad flat segments, set in a shallow
and plaited basin. Stalk, three quarters of an inch long, obliquely
inserted in a moderately deep cavity, with generally a fleshy
protuberance on one side of it. Flesh, yellow, firm, crisp, juicy, and
very sugary; with a brisk and particularly rich flavor.

This is one of the best and richest flavored of our dessert apples. It
is only of recent introduction; but will no doubt, ere long, prove one
of the most popular, as it is one of the most valuable varieties in its
class; not only on account of its excellence, but for the long period
during which it is in perfection; it comes into use in October and
November, and continues in good condition till March.

A communication of some importance has been forwarded to me by Mr.
Cameron of Uckfield, by whom this variety was first propagated. He
says the fruit should be allowed to hang late on the tree before it is
gathered, so as to secure its peculiar richness of flavor, and long
period of duration; for if gathered too soon, it looses much of its
fine richness and is very apt to shrivel.

The tree does not attain a large size, but is perfectly hardy, and an
early and excellent bearer; young trees, only two or three years from
the graft, producing a considerable crop of handsome, well-grown fruit.

This esteemed variety originated about the year 1770, in a garden now
in the possession of Mr. Mannington, a respectable butcher at Uckfield
in Sussex. At the time it was raised the garden belonged to Mr. Turley,
a blacksmith, and grandfather of Mr. Mannington. The original tree grew
up at the root of a hedge, where the refuse from a cider press had been
thrown; it never attained any great size, but continued to preserve a
stunted, and diminutive habit of growth, till it died about the year
1820. Previous to this, however, grafts had been freely distributed to
persons in the neighbourhood, many of whom were anxious to possess such
a desideratum; but it does not seem to have been known beyond its own
locality, till the autumn of 1847, when Mr. Mannington caused specimens
of the fruit to be forwarded to the London Horticultural Society,
and by whom it was pronounced to be a dessert fruit of the highest
excellence. It was designated by Mr. Thompson “Mannington’s Pearmain.”

Fruit, medium sized; roundish-ovate, and narrowing towards the eye,
where it is angular. Skin, greenish-yellow on the shaded side; but
bright-red next the sun, striped all over with darker red, and strewed
with grey russety dots. Eye, half open, and prominent; with long,
broad, erect segments, surrounded with a number of puckered knobs.
Stalk, short and thick, about half-an-inch long, inserted in a small,
and shallow cavity. Flesh, greenish-white, brisk, juicy, and vinous,
with a pleasant and very refreshing flavor.

A first-rate early dessert apple; it is ripe in the beginning of
August, but does not keep long, being very liable to become meally. To
have it in perfection, it is well to gather it a few days before it
ripens on the tree, and thereby secure its juicy, and vinous flavor.

The tree does not attain a large size, being rather a small grower.
It is a good bearer, more so than the Joanneting, and is quite hardy,
except in light soils, when it is liable to canker. It is well adapted
for growing as dwarfs, either for potting or being trained as an
espalier, when grafted on the paradise, or pomme paradis stock.

This is a very old English apple. It is without doubt the Margaret
of Rea, Worldige, Ray, and all our early pomologists except Miller;
Mr. Lindley, however, is of a different opinion, for he believes the
Margaret of Miller to be identical with that of Ray. That this variety
is the Margaret of Rea, his description is sufficient evidence. “The
_Margaret or Magdelen Apple_ is a fair and beautiful fruit, yellow, and
thick striped with red, early ripe, of a delicate taste, sweet flavor,
and best eaten off the tree.” Ray gives _no description_ of it, but it
is only reasonable to suppose, that it is this variety he refers to,
seeing it is the Margaret of all authors both immediately preceeding,
and subsequent to him. And indeed in no instance is that of Miller
noticed by any English author, but himself, anterior to Mr. Lindley.

terminate at the crown in five prominent ridges. Skin, orange,
streaked with deep red, and covered on one side with patches of russet.
Eye, small and closed, compressed as it were between the angles of the
basin. Stalk, half-an-inch long, slender, and rather deeply inserted
in a round, and russety cavity. Flesh, yellow, firm, juicy, rich, and
sugary, with a powerful, and delicious aromatic flavor.

One of the finest dessert apples, a rival of the Ribston Pippin,
excelling it in juiciness, and being of a better size for the dessert;
it is in use from November to February.

The tree is quite hardy, and generally an abundant bearer, except in
seasons when the bloom is injured by frosts, to which it is liable. It
is of a small, and slender habit of growth, and is well adapted for
growing as dwarfs, or espaliers, when grafted on the paradise stock.

There seems to be no record of this variety before the publication
of the _Pomona Londonensis_, although it was known for many years
previously. Rogers says, he saw a tree of it growing as an espalier in
the garden at Sheen, which was planted by Sir William Temple. I find it
was cultivated to a considerable extent in the Brompton Park nursery,
so early as 1750; it must therefore have been well known at that
period; but I cannot discover any trace of its origin. It may have been
introduced from the continent by George London who was for some years
in the gardens at Versailles under De Quintinye, and afterwards in
partnership with Henry Wise as proprietor of the Brompton Park nursery,
as the name seems to indicate more of French than English origin.

flattened at the apex, where it terminates in several prominences.
Skin, very thick, hard, and membranous; deep yellow, with a brownish
tinge next the sun, and strewed with numerous imbedded pearly specks.
Eye, small and open, with long acuminate and reflexed segments, set
in a deep, and angular basin. Stalk, half-an-inch long, inserted in
a deep, and smooth cavity. Flesh, yellowish-white, firm and tender,
sweet, juicy, and pleasantly flavored.

A culinary apple, but only of second-rate quality; it is in use from
October to January.

The tree is hardy and an abundant bearer.

This variety was introduced in 1818--the year in which the original
tree first produced fruit--by a Mr. Stevens of Stanton Grange, in
Derbyshire, by whom it was raised from a seed of the Keswick Codling.
The Marmalade Pippin of Diel which is described in the 22 vol. and
which he says is an English apple, is not the same as the above, for he
describes it as “a true streaked apple, and ripe in August”.

An excellent dessert apple, but equal to the old Nonpareil;
consequently can only be regarded as a second-rate variety; it is in
use from December to March.

The tree is a vigorous grower, hardy and a good bearer.

This apple was received from a nursery, as a crab stock, by the Rev.
George Williams of Martin-Hussingtree, near Worcester, and after
producing fruit, was communicated by him to the London Horticultural
Society.

Fruit, medium sized, two inches and three quarters wide, and the same

eye, but generally of an ovate shape. Skin, thin and tender, pale green
at first, changing as it ripens to fine delicate waxen-yellow, on the
shaded side; but covered with fine dark crimson, on the side next the
sun. Eye, small and closed, with long acuminate segments, and set in a
pretty wide, and deep basin, which is sometimes a little ribbed. Stalk,
three quarters of an inch long, inserted in a small, and smooth cavity.
Flesh, white with a greenish tinge, very delicate, juicy, and tender,
with a sweet and vinous flavor, and a perfume like that of roses.

A dessert apple, which, when in perfection, is of the most exquisite
flavor, but being indigenous to a warmer climate, it does not attain
its full maturity in this country. By the aid of a south wall, in
a warm and sheltered situation, it may however be brought to some
degree of perfection. At Elvaston Castle, Mr. Barron has successfully
cultivated it upon earthen mounds, with an inclination to the sun, of
45°. When in perfection, its flesh is said to be as melting as that of
the Beurré, and Doyenné pears; it is in use from December to March.

The tree is a strong, and vigorous grower, and an abundant bearer.

This apple is of Italian origin, and is extensively cultivated about
Turin. Its name is by some supposed to have been given in honor of
Charlemagne, who is said to have held this fruit in high estimation.


226. MELROSE.--H.

 SYNONYME.--White Melrose, _Hort. Soc. Cat._ ed. 3, p. 25.

[Illustration]

Fruit, large; roundish-ovate, inclining to conical, and broad at the
base; it has an irregularity in its outline, caused by prominent ribs,
which extend from about the middle, to the basin of the eye, where they
form large and unequal ridges; and also by several flattened parts on
the sides, giving it the appearance as if indented by a blow. Skin,
smooth and shining, pale yellow tinged with green, on the shaded side;
but yellow tinged with orange, and marked with crimson spots and dots,
on the side exposed to the sun. Eye, large and closed, with broad flat
segments, and deeply set in a plaited, and prominently ribbed basin.
Stalk, very short, not more than a quarter of an inch long, inserted
in a deep, irregular cavity, in which are a few streaks and patches of
rough russet. Flesh, yellowish-white, firm, but tender and marrow-like,
with a sweet, and pleasantly sub-acid flavor.

A very valuable and fine looking apple, of first-rate quality, suitable
either for culinary purposes or the dessert; it is in use from October
to January.

The tree is a strong, healthy, and vigorous grower, and forms a large
round head. It is also an abundant and free bearer.

This is an old Scotch apple, the cultivation of which is confined
exclusively to the Border counties, where it was probably first
introduced by the monks of Melrose Abbey. Though it is one of the most
popular apples of the Tweedside orchards, it does not seem to have been
ever known beyond its own district. It is without doubt the largest,
and one of the most useful apples of which Scotland can boast, and
requires only to be more generally known, to be cultivated throughout
the length and breadth of that country. Even in the south it is not to
be disregarded, as both in size, and quality, it is one of the most
attractive market apples. I have known them sold at two shillings a
dozen. The figure given above is only from a medium-sized specimen of
the fruit.

Fruit, above medium size, three inches wide, and two inches and a
half high; roundish, and considerably flattened, almost oblate. Skin,
yellow, covered with dark dots, and a few veins of russet; russety over
the base, and marked with a few broken stripes and mottles of pale
crimson on the side next the sun. Eye, large and open, with short, and
ragged segments, set in a wide, shallow, and plaited basin. Stalk,
half-an-inch long, inserted in a rather shallow cavity. Flesh, white,
firm, crisp, and juicy, with a rough, and sharp acid flavor.

A culinary apple, but only of second-rate quality; it is in use from
November to March.

The tree is very hardy, and is not subject to canker, or the attacks of
insects. It is an abundant bearer.

This apple is extensively grown in the southern parts of Lancashire,
and is a great favorite in the Manchester market, and all the other
manufacturing towns of that district. It receives its name from the
village of Minchall in Cheshire, where, according to Rogers, the
original tree existed in 1777.


229. MINIER’S DUMPLING.--Hort.

 IDENTIFICATION.--Hort. Trans. vol. i. 70. Fors. Treat. 114. Lind.
 Guide, 54.

Fruit, large, from three to three inches and a half wide, and nearly
the same in height; roundish, somewhat flattened and angular on the
sides. Skin, dark green, striped with darker green on the shaded side;
but covered with dark red where exposed to the sun. Stalk, an inch
long, rather thick, inserted in a rather deep cavity. Flesh, firm,
juicy, sub-acid and pleasantly flavored.

An excellent culinary apple, of first-rate quality; in use from
November to May.

The tree is a strong grower, hardy, and an excellent bearer.


230. MITCHELSON’S SEEDLING.--H.

[Illustration]

Fruit, above the medium size; somewhat ovate. Skin, of a fine deep
yellow, thinly strewed with minute brown dots, interspersed with
slight patches of very delicate russet; but faintly mottled with clear
red, on the side exposed to the sun. Eye, large and open, with short
stunted segments, and set in a rather deep, and plaited basin. Stalk,
very short, inserted in a round, and even cavity, which is tinged with
green, and lined with fine delicate grey russet. Flesh, yellowish,
firm, crisp, brisk, very juicy and vinous, abounding in a rich and
agreeable perfume.

A very excellent apple, suitable either for culinary purposes, or the
dessert; it is in use from December to February.

This beautiful apple, was raised by Mr. Mitchelson, a market gardener
at Kingston-on-Thames.


231. MONKLAND PIPPIN.--Hort.

 IDENTIFICATION.--Hort. Soc. Cat. ed. 3, n. 442.

Fruit, small, two inches wide, and the same in height; oval, even, and
regularly formed, with five obscure ribs round the eye. Skin, green,
becoming yellow as it attains maturity, marked with imbedded green
specks, and numerous very minute dots. Eye, half open, set in a round,
and plaited basin. Stalk, three quarters of an inch long, slender, and
inserted in a round, narrow cavity, which is lined with rough russet.
Flesh, greenish-white, soft and juicy, but with little or no flavor.

An apple of which it is difficult to say to what use it is applicable,
having nothing whatever to recommend it; it is ripe in November.


232. MONKTON.--H.

Fruit, below medium size, two inches and three quarters wide, and two
inches high; oblate, slightly ribbed on the sides, and ridged round
the eye. Skin, entirely covered with beautiful red, which is marked
with spots, and broken stripes of deep crimson; the color on the shaded
side is paler than on the side exposed to the sun; it is strewed all
over with russety dots, and round the stalk, and in the basin of the
eye it is of a clear waxen-yellow. Eye, small and open, with broad,
erect segments, set in a moderately deep basin. Stalk, short and thick,
inserted in a rather shallow cavity, which is lined with thick grey
russet. Flesh, yellowish, tender, juicy, and brisk.

A beautiful cider apple, raised at Monkton, near Taunton, in
Somersetshire.


233. MOORE’S SEEDLING.--H.

Fruit, large, three inches and a quarter wide, and three inches high;
conical and angular, flattened at the base. Skin, greenish-yellow on
the shaded side; and marked with broken streaks of red where exposed to
the sun, interspersed with numerous large dark spots. Eye, small and
open, set in a plaited basin. Stalk, very short, imbedded in a small,
narrow cavity, and surrounded with a patch of russet. Flesh, yellow,
tender, rather sweet and pleasantly flavored.

A good culinary apple; ripe in October, and keeps till December.


234. MORRIS’S COURT OF WICK.--H.

Fruit, small, two inches and a quarter broad, and an inch and three
quarters high; roundish-oblate, regularly and handsomely shaped, very
closely resembling its parent, the old Court of Wick. Skin, pale green
on the shaded side; but washed with light red next the sun, which is
covered with darker red spots, and marked with thin grey russet, round
the eye. Eye, open, with reflexed segments, equally as characteristic
as that of the old Court of Wick, and placed in a wide, shallow basin.
Stalk, half-an-inch long, inserted in a round cavity. Flesh, firm but
tender, with a profusion of rich, vinous, and highly flavored juice.

A delicious dessert apple, excelling even the old Court of Wick; it is
in use from October to February.

This variety was raised some years ago, by Mr. Morris, a market
gardener at Brentford, near London.


235. MORRIS’S NONPAREIL RUSSET.--Hort.

 SYNONYME AND FIGURE.--Nonpareil Russet, _Ron. Pyr. Mal._ 25, pl. xiii.
 f. 3.

[Illustration]

Fruit, small; conical and irregularly formed, being generally larger
on one side than the other, and having the eye placed laterally. Skin,
green, covered with large patches of thin grey russet, strewed with
silvery scales, and marked with green dots. Eye, small and open, with
segments reflexed at the tips, and set in a plaited basin. Stalk,
short, and deeply inserted in an oblique cavity. Flesh, greenish, firm,
crisp, juicy, sugary, briskly flavored, and charged with a pleasant
aroma.

An excellent dessert apple, of the first quality; in use from October
to March, and will keep even as long as May and June.

Can this be the same as the Morris’s Nonpareil Russet, of the London
Horticultural Society’s catalogue, which is said to be oblate? I know
that the variety described above is the true one, the friend from whom
I received it having procured it from Mr. Morris himself.

This variety was raised by Mr. Morris of Brentford.


236. MORRIS’S RUSSET.--H.

Fruit below medium size, two inches and a half wide, and two inches and
a quarter high; round, regularly and handsomely shaped. Skin, covered
with a coat of smooth, thin, brown russet, with occasionally a bright,
fiery-crimson flame breaking out on the side next the sun, sometimes
so large as to form a fine, smooth, and varnished crimson cheek. Eye,
large and open, set in a small and shallow basin. Stalk, very short,
inserted in a rather small cavity. Flesh, firm, but tender, juicy,
brisk and sugary, charged with a very rich, and powerful aromatic
flavor.

This is a dessert apple, of the highest excellence, and ought certainly
to form one in every collection, however small; it is in season from
October to February.

This, like the two preceeding varieties, was raised by Mr. Morris of
Brentford.


237. NANNY.--Hort.

 IDENTIFICATION.--Hort. Soc. Cat. ed. 3, n. 452.

Fruit, medium sized, two inches and three quarters wide, and two
inches and a half high; roundish, narrowing towards the apex, and
somewhat angular on the sides. Skin, smooth, greenish-yellow with
broken streaks of red, on the shaded side; but bright red, streaked
with dark crimson, on the side next the sun; the whole strewed with
russety dots. Eye, open, with flat segments, placed in an angular
basin, which is marked with linear marks of russet. Stalk, short,
inserted in a rather deep, round cavity, thickly lined with rough
russet, which extends in ramifications over the base. Flesh, yellow,
rather soft and tender, juicy, sugary, and highly flavored.

A dessert apple of excellent quality, and when in perfection, a
first-rate fruit; it is in use during October, but soon becomes meally.

The tree attains the middle size and is a good bearer, much more so
than the Ribston Pippin, to which the fruit bears some resemblance in
flavor.

shining, of a beautiful pale waxen-yellow color, tinged with pale red,
on the shaded side; but covered with deeper red, on the side next the
sun. Eye, small, half open, and set in a shallow and plaited basin.
Stalk, half-an-inch long, inserted in a round, and pretty deep cavity.
Flesh, pure white, very tender and delicate, sweet and pleasantly
flavored.

A very beautiful and handsome apple, but not of great merit. It is
suitable for dessert use, and is in perfection from November to January.

The tree is of a small habit of growth, hardy, and bears well; but in
some soils it is liable to canker.

This variety is supposed to be of Canadian origin, and was introduced
to this country by a Mr. Barclay, of Brompton near London. This is not
the Pomme de Neige of Diel.

[Illustration]

Fruit, large and handsome; conical or oblong. Skin, greenish-yellow
strewed with russety specks, on the shaded side; but where exposed to
the sun of a fine deep yellow, covered with rather large dark spots,
which are encircled with a dark crimson ring. Eye, open, with short
segments, set in a deep, plaited, and irregular basin. Stalk, about a
quarter of an inch long, inserted in a very deep, and angular cavity.
Flesh, yellowish-white, delicate, tender, juicy and sugary.

A very excellent apple, of first-rate quality as a culinary fruit, and
also valuable for the dessert; it is in use from September to January.

This variety was discovered many years ago, in the West Riding of
Yorkshire, where it is now cultivated to a large extent. It was
first brought into notice by John Nelson, a noted Wesleyan preacher
in that part of the country, who, during his professional visits
distributed grafts of it among his friends. From this circumstance
it became generally known by the name of the Nelson Apple. It was
called Backhouse’s Lord Nelson by Mr. Ronalds in the Pyrus Malus
Brentfordiensis, from having been received from the York nursery; but
Mr. Backhouse, to whom it refers, disclaims having any merit either in
the origin or introduction of it, and prefers retaining simply the name
of “Nelson”, as a tribute to the memory of the excellent man after whom
it was named.

The tree is a strong, vigorous, and healthy grower, and a most abundant
bearer.


240. NEW ROCK PIPPIN.--Hort.

 IDENTIFICATION.--Hort. Trans. vol. v. p. 269. Hort. Soc. Cat. ed. 3,
 n. 460. Lind. Guide, 75.

Fruit, of medium size; round. Skin, dull green on the shaded side, and
brownish-red where exposed to the sun, entirely covered with brown
russet. Eye, deeply set in a round basin. Stalk, short. Flesh, yellow,
firm, sweet, rich, and perfumed with the flavor of anise.

A dessert apple of first-rate quality; in use from January to May.

This variety was raised by Mr. William Pleasance, a nurseryman at
Barnwell, near Cambridge, and was communicated by him to the London
Horticultural Society, in 1821. It belongs to the Nonpareil family, and
is valuable as a late winter apple.

Fruit, medium sized; roundish, broadest at the base, with broad obscure
ribs extending to the apex, which give it an irregularity in its
outline. Skin, at first dull green, but changing as it ripens to a fine
olive-green, or greenish-yellow, with a redish-brown tinge next the
sun, and dotted all over with small grey russety dots. Eye, small and
closed, set in a small and rather shallow basin. Stalk, half-an-inch
long, slender, and inserted all its length, in a deep, round cavity
lined with delicate russet, which extends over a portion of the base.
Flesh, yellowish-white tinged with green, firm, crisp, very juicy, with
a rich, and highly aromatic flavor.

A dessert apple, which, when in perfection, is not to be surpassed. It
is in use from December to April. This description being taken from an
imported specimen, it must not be expected that fruit grown in this
country, will attain the same degree of perfection; for like most of
the best American apples, it does not succeed in this climate. Even
with the protection of a wall, and in the most favorable situation, it
does not possess that peculiarly rich aroma, which characterizes the
imported fruit.

The tree is a slender, and slow grower, and is always distinguished,
even in its young state, by the roughness of its bark. It prefers a
strong, rich, and genial soil, and, according to Coxe, does not arrive
at maturity till 20 or 25 years old.

This is an old American apple. It originated at Newtown, on Long
Island, U. S., and was introduced to this country about the middle
of the last century. I find it was cultivated in the Brompton Park
nursery so early as 1768, under the name of “Newtown Pippin from New
York.” Forsyth remarks that it is said to have been originally from
Devonshire, but if it were so, there would still have been some trace
of it left in that county. It is extensively cultivated in New York,
and all the middle states, and particularly on the Hudson, where the
finest American orchards are. There are immense quantities produced
which are packed in barrels and exported to Britain and other parts.
The month of January, is generally the season they arrive in this
country, and then they are the most attractive of all dessert apples in
Covent Garden market; the name serving in many instances, as a decoy
for the sale of many other and inferior varieties. The Alfriston, in
many collections, is erroneously cultivated under the name of Newtown
Pippin.

Fruit, above medium size, three inches and a quarter wide, and two
inches and a quarter deep; roundish, regularly and handsomely formed,
a little flattened, somewhat resembling a Nonesuch. Skin, smooth, at
first pale-yellow tinged with green, but changing to a beautiful clear
yellow, on the shaded side; but of a beautiful clear red streaked with
deeper red, on the side next the sun, and strewed with numerous small,
russety dots. Eye, open, set in a wide, and even basin. Stalk, short
and stout, inserted in a deep cavity. Flesh, yellowish, firm, rich and
pleasantly flavored.

An American dessert apple, very pretty, and handsome; of good quality,
but only second-rate; it is in use from November to February.

This variety originated at Newtown on Long Island U. S. It received the
name of Matchless, from the late William Cobbett, who sold it under
that name.


243. NEW YORK PIPPIN.--Lind.

 IDENTIFICATION.--Lind, Plan. Or. Lind. Guide, 76.

Fruit, rather large, of an oblong figure, somewhat pyramidal, rather
irregular in its outline, and slightly pentangular on its sides, three
of which are generally much shorter than the other, forming a kind of
lip at the crown; from two inches and a half to three inches deep, and
the same in diameter at the base. Eye, closed, rather deeply sunk in a
very uneven irregular basin. Stalk, half-an-inch long, slender, rather
deeply inserted in a wide uneven cavity. Skin, dull greenish-yellow,
with a few green specks, intermixed with a little skin, (thin?) grey
russet, and tinged with brown on the sunny side. Flesh, firm, crisp,
tender. Juice, plentiful, saccharine, with a slight aromatic flavor.

A dessert apple; in use from November to April.

An American variety of excellence. The tree grows large, and bears well.
It sometimes happens with this as it does with Hubbard’s Pearmain, that
smooth fruit grow upon one branch and russety ones upon another; and in
cold seasons the fruit are for the most part russety.

It was named the New York Pippin by Mr. Mackie, and first propagated in
his nursery, at Norwich, about forty years ago. (1831.)

Never having seen or met with this apple, I have here given Mr.
Lindley’s descriptions verbatim, for the benefit of those who may meet
with it; as it is no doubt still in existence in the county of Norfolk.

 FIGURE.--Ron. Pyr. Mal. pl. xxxvii. f. 2.

Fruit, medium sized, two inches and a half wide, and two inches and a

smooth, pale yellow, mottled with thin pale red, on the shaded side;
and striped with broad, broken stripes of red next the sun. Eye, small
and closed, set in a wide, shallow, and even basin. Stalk, short and
slender, inserted in a shallow cavity. Flesh, white, tender, juicy,
sugary and slightly perfumed.

An excellent culinary apple, of first-rate quality, and, according to
Mr. Thompson, excellent for apple jelly; it is ripe in September, and
continues during October.

The tree is a free grower, attaining about the middle size, and is an
abundant, and early bearer, young trees three years old from the graft
producing an abundance of beautiful fruit.

Although an old variety, I do not think this is the Nonesuch, of Rea,
Worlidge, or Ray, as all these authors mention it as being a long
keeper, for which circumstance, it might otherwise have been considered
the same. Rea says “it is a middle sized, round, and red striped apple,
of a delicate taste, and long lasting.” Worlidge’s variety is probably
the same as Rea’s he says “The Non-such is a long lasting fruit, good
at the table, and well marked for cider.” And Ray also includes his
Non-such among the Winter Apples.

of thin grey russet, and dotted with small brown russety dots, with
occasionally a tinge of dull red, on the side next the sun. Eye, rather
prominent, very slightly if at all depressed, half open, with broad
segments which are reflexed at the tips. Stalk, an inch long, set in
a round and pretty deep cavity which is lined with russet. Flesh,
greenish, delicate, crisp, rich, and juicy, abounding in a particularly
rich, vinous, and aromatic flavor.

One of the most highly esteemed and popular of all our dessert apples.
It is in use from January till May.

The tree is a free grower, and healthy, scarcely attaining the middle
size, and an excellent bearer. It prefers a light and warm soil,
succeeds well on the paradise stock, and is well adapted for growing
in pots, when grafted on the pomme paradis of the French. Bradley in
one of his tracts records an instance of it being so cultivated. “Mr.
Fairchild (of Hoxton) has now (February) one of the Nonpareile apples
upon a small tree, in a pot, which seems capable of holding good till
the blossoms of this year have ripened their fruit.” In the northern
counties and in Scotland, it does not succeed as a standard as it does
in the south, and even when grown against a wall, there is a marked
contrast in the flavor when compared with the standard grown fruit of
the south.

It is generally allowed that the Nonpareil is originally from France.
Switzer says “It is no stranger in England; though it might have its
original from France, yet there are trees of them about the Ashtons in
Oxfordshire, of about a hundred years old, which (as they have it by
tradition) was first brought out of France and planted by a Jesuit in
Queen Mary or Queen Elizabeth’s time.” It is strange, however, that an
apple of such excellence, and held in such estimation as the Nonpareil
has always been, should have received so little notice from almost all
the early continental pomologists. It is not mentioned in the long
list of the Jardinier François of 1653, nor even by De Quintinye, or
the Jardinier Solitaire. Schabol enumerates it, but it is not noticed
by Bretonnerie. It is first described by Duhamel and subsequently by
Knoop. In the Chartreux catalogue it is said “elle est forte estimée
en Angleterre”, but, among the writers of our own country, Switzer is
the first to notice it. It is not mentioned by Rea, Worlidge or Ray,
neither is it enumerated in the list of Leonard Meager. In America it
is little esteemed.

Fruit, medium sized, three inches wide, and two inches and three
quarters high; oblate, irregular in its outline, caused by several
obtuse angles or ribs, which extend from the base to the basin of the
eye, where they form prominent knobs or ridges. Skin, smooth, green at
first, but changing to yellow, and almost entirely covered with dull
brownish-red, which is thickest and darkest next the sun; sometimes it
is marked with a few broken stripes of dark crimson, and in specimens
where the color extends over the whole surface, the shaded side is
mottled with yellow spots. Eye, open, set in a rather deep and angular
basin. Stalk short, inserted in a deep and russety cavity. Flesh, firm
and crisp, with a brisk and pleasant flavor.

A well known and first-rate culinary apple; it is in use from January
to June. It is extensively cultivated in Norfolk, where, besides being
applied to general culinary purposes, they are baked in ovens, and form
the dried fruits met with among confectioners and fruiterers, called
“Norfolk Biffins.”

The tree is vigorous in its young state, but unless grown in a rich
soil, and a favorable situation, it is apt to canker, particularly if
it is too moist.

The name of this apple has hitherto been written Beaufin, as if of
French origin; but it is more correctly Beefing, from the similarity
the dried fruit presents to raw beef.

by keeping to pale yellow with a mixture of green; sometimes it has
a slight tinge of red next the sun. Eye, small, half open, with
acuminate segments, set in a rather shallow and wide basin. Stalk,
slender, half-an-inch long, inserted in a shallow cavity with a fleshy
protuberance on one side of it. Flesh, white, firm and breaking, brisk,
sweet, and perfumed.

An excellent long-keeping culinary apple, and useful also in the
dessert; it is in use from November to July. In the “Guide to the
Orchard,” Mr. Lindley says “This is a valuable Norfolk Apple known in
the Norwich market by the name of White Pippin. The fruit when peeled,
sliced, and boiled in sugar, becomes transparent, affording for many
months a most delicious sweetmeat for tarts.”

The tree is a free and vigorous grower, and attains the middle size. It
is a regular and abundant bearer.

three inches high; roundish, inclining to ovate, being narrowed towards
the eye. Skin, smooth and tender, of a beautiful grassy green in the
shade, and dull brownish-red marked with a few broken stripes of a
darker color, on the side exposed to the sun. Eye, small and closed,
with long segments, set in a narrow, round, deep, and even basin.
Stalk, three quarters of an inch long, inserted in a narrow and deep
cavity. Flesh, greenish-white, tender, crisp, and very juicy, with a
brisk and somewhat vinous flavor.

An excellent culinary apple of first-rate quality; in use from November
to April.

The tree is a very strong and vigorous grower, attaining the largest
size, and is an abundant bearer.

This is sometimes called Cowarne Queening, but that is a very different
variety, and is a cider apple.


250. NOTTINGHAM PIPPIN.--H.

Fruit, medium sized, two inches and three quarters broad, and two
inches and a half high; ovate. Skin, smooth, pale yellow at first, but
changing by keeping to lemon yellow, without any trace of red, but with
slight markings of russet. Eye, closed, with long green segments, set
in a wide and rather deeply plaited basin. Stalk, three quarters of
an inch long, inserted in a deep, funnel-shaped, and russety cavity.
Flesh, white, fine and marrowy, juicy, sugary, and vinous.

A second-rate dessert apple; in use from November till February.

The tree is a strong and vigorous grower, and an excellent bearer.

 SYNONYME.--Simpson’s Pippin, _acc. Hort. Trans._

 FIGURE.--Hort. Trans. vol. ii. t. 19.

[Illustration]

Fruit, medium sized; conical or oblong, very irregular in its outline,
caused by prominent and unequal ribs on the sides, which extend to
and terminate in ridges round the eye. Skin, smooth and shining, deep
grassy green, strewed with imbedded grey specks, and dotted with brown
russety dots on the shaded side; but washed with thin brownish-red,
which is marked with spots or patches of darker and livelier red,
and strewed with star-like freckles of russet on the side exposed to
the sun. Eye, small and closed, placed in a rather deep and angular
basin, which is lined with linear marks of rough russet. Stalk, about
half-an-inch long, somewhat obliquely inserted by the side of a fleshy
swelling, which is more or less prominent. Flesh, greenish-white,
tender, crisp, and brittle, abounding in a profusion of rich, brisk,
sugary, and vinous juice, with a finely perfumed and refreshing flavor.

An excellent apple, of first-rate quality, and well deserving of more
general cultivation; It is in use from January to May, and keeps well.

Some thirty years ago, Ord’s apple was brought into public notice
as a variety which was worthy of universal cultivation; and was
considered of such importance as to form the subject of a paper in the
Horticultural Society’s Transactions, by A. Salisbury Esq. At that
time it was received into all the collections in the London nurseries,
and was very generally grown; but in the course of years it was again
lost sight of, and I believe there are now very few places where it
is to be met with. I shall be glad, however, if this notice should
direct the attention of some lover of a good apple, to rescue this
excellent variety from the oblivion into which it is likely to fall,
and to restore it to the position it once occupied as one of our finest
dessert apples.

This excellent variety originated at Purser’s Cross, near Fulham,
Middlesex. It was raised in the garden of John Ord, Esq. by his
sister-in-law, Mrs. Anne Simpson, from seed of a Newtown Pippin
imported in 1777. There is another variety called _Simpson’s Seedling_,
raised from the seed of Ord’s apple, to which it is very similar; but
being much inferior in quality, its cultivation has been in a great
measure discontinued.

 FIGURES.--Pom. Mag. t. 5. Ron. Pyr. Mal. pl. vi. f. 2.

Fruit, medium sized, two inches and a half wide, and two inches
high; roundish-oblate, evenly and regularly formed. Skin, thick and
membranous, of a fine pale yellow color, and thickly strewed with brown
dots; very frequently cracked, forming large and deep sinuosities on
the fruit. Eye, scarcely at all depressed. Stalk, short and thick,
inserted in a very shallow cavity. Flesh, yellowish, firm, crisp
and juicy, rich and sugary, with a highly aromatic flavor, which is
peculiar to this apple only.

A dessert apple of the highest excellence; ripe in the end of August,
and continues during September, but does not last long. Nicol says
“this is an excellent apple, as to flavor it is outdone by none but the
Nonpareil, over which it has this advantage, that it will ripen in a
worse climate and a worse aspect.”

The tree is a free grower, of an upright habit, and an excellent
bearer; but is subject to canker as it grows old. The branches are
generally covered with a number of knobs or burrs; and when planted in
the ground these burrs throw out numerous fibres which take root and
produce a perfect tree.

This is a very old Scotch apple, supposed to have originated at
Arbroath; or to have been introduced from France by the monks of the
Abbey which formerly existed at that place. The latter opinion is, in
all probability, the correct one, although the name, or any of the
synonymes quoted above are not now to be met with in any modern French
lists. But in the “Jardinier François” which was published in 1651, I
find an apple mentioned under the name of Orgeran, which is so similar
in pronounciation to Orgeline, I think it not unlikely it may be the
same name with a change of orthography, especially as our ancestors
were not over particular, in preserving unaltered the names of foreign
introductions.


253. OSTERLEY PIPPIN.--H.

 SYNONYME AND FIGURE.--Osterley Apple, _Ron. Pyr. Mal._ 59, pl. xxx. f.
 1.

Fruit, rather below medium size, two inches and a half wide, and two
inches and a quarter high; orbicular, flattened at the base and apex.
Skin, yellowish-green, strewed with thin russet and russety dots on the
shaded side; but washed with thin red, and strewed with russety specks
on the side next the sun. Eye, large and open, with short stunted
segments, set in a wide and shallow basin. Stalk, half-an-inch long,
inserted in a wide, and rather shallow cavity, which is lined with thin
russet. Flesh, greenish-yellow, firm, crisp, rich, juicy and sugary,
with a brisk and aromatic flavor, somewhat resembling, and little
inferior to the Ribston Pippin.

A handsome and very excellent dessert apple; it is in use from October
to February, and is not subject to be attacked with the grub, as the
Ribston Pippin is.

This variety was raised from the seed of the Ribston Pippin, at
Osterley Park, the seat of the Earl of Jersey, near Isleworth,
Middlesex, where the original tree is still in existence.


254. OXNEAD PEARMAIN.--Lind.

 IDENTIFICATION.--Lind. Guide, 78.

 SYNONYME.--Earl of Yarmouth’s Pearmain, _Lind. Pl. Or._ 1796.

Fruit, small and conical. Skin, entirely grass green, always covered
with a thin russet; sometimes when highly ripened it is tinged with a
very pale brown on the sunny side. Eye, very small, surrounded with
a few obscure plaits. Stalk, very slender, three quarters of an inch
long. Flesh, pale green, very firm and crisp, not juicy, but very rich
and highly flavored.

A dessert apple; in use from November to April.

I have never seen this apple. It was first noticed by Mr. George
Lindley whose description of it I have given above. He says “it is
supposed to have originated at Oxnead, near Norwich, the seat of the
Earl of Yarmouth. It has been known many years in Norfolk, no doubt
prior to the extinction of that Peerage in 1733, and I have never seen
it out of the county. The tree is a very small grower; its branches
are small and wiry and of a grass green color; it is very hardy and an
excellent bearer.”

 FIGURES.--Pom. Mag. t. 151. Ron. Pyr. Mal. pl. xvi. f. 5.

Fruit, small, two inches wide, and an inch and a half high;
roundish-oblate. Skin, pale greenish-yellow rather thickly covered with
thin grey russet, and faintly tinged with orange next the sun. Eye,
small and closed, set in a shallow and rather angular basin. Stalk,
three quarters of an inch long, slender, and inserted in a rather
shallow cavity. Flesh, yellow, juicy, sugary, brisk and richly aromatic.

A dessert apple of first-rate quality; in use during December and
January.

The tree is of small dimensions, but healthy, and a prolific bearer.
It is well adapted for dwarf training, when grown on the paradise or
doucin stock.

This variety was raised by Mr. Padley, gardener to his Majesty George
III., at Hampton Court. According to Rogers, Mr. Padley was a native
of Yorkshire, and after coming to London and filling a situation of
respectability, he was appointed foreman in the kitchen garden at Kew.
“On the death of the celebrated ‘Capability Brown’ Mr. G. Haverfield
was removed from Kew to Hampton Court, and took Mr. Padley with him
as foreman. On the death of Haverfield, Padley’s interest with his
sovereign out-weighed all the interests of other candidates, though
urged by the most influential persons about Court. ‘No, no, no,’ said
his Majesty, ‘it is Padley’s birthright.’”

[Illustration]

Fruit, small; oval, and regular in its shape. Skin, almost entirely
covered with dark dull red, and striped with brighter red, except
a portion on the shaded side, which is green; the whole surface is
thickly strewed with small russety dots, which give it a speckled
appearance. Eye, small and open, set in a shallow basin. Stalk,
sometimes short and fleshy as represented in the accompanying figure;
and at other times, about half-an-inch long, and woody, but still
retaining the swollen boss at its union with the fruit. Flesh, firm in
texture, crisp, very juicy and pleasantly acid, with a sweet, brisk,
and poignant flavor.

A nice sharp-flavored dessert apple; but considered only of second-rate
quality; it is in use from December to March.

on the sides, which extend into the basin of the eye. Skin, pale
straw-colored, almost white, with a few stripes of red on the shaded
side; but entirely covered with beautiful crimson, which is striped
with darker crimson, and strewed with small grey dots where exposed
to the sun. Eye, large and closed, set in a rather shallow and ribbed
basin. Stalk, fleshy, set in a wide and deep cavity. Flesh, very white,
tinged with red, more so than the Passe Pomme Rouge, tender, juicy,
rich, sugary and vinous.

An excellent autumn culinary apple; ripe in September.

The tree is vigorous and healthy, but does not attain a large size.
It is a very abundant bearer, and well suited for dwarf training when
grown on the paradise or doucin stock.

Dahuron says of this apple “on la nomme en Hollande _Pomme de
Jerusalem_;” but according to Knoop, the Dutch pomologist, it is the
Pigeon, which is known under that name.

 FIGURE.--Nois. Jard. Fruit, ed. 2, pl. 92.

Fruit, small; roundish-oblate, even and regularly formed. Skin, thick,
red all over, pale on the shaded side, but of a deep and bright
color next the sun; and so sensitive of shade, if any portion of it
is covered with a leaf or twig, a corresponding yellow mark will be
found on the fruit. Eye, small, set in a narrow, even, and rather
deep basin. Stalk, half-an-inch long, slender, set in a wide, deep,
and even cavity. Flesh, white, tinged with red under the skin on the
side exposed to the sun, crisp, juicy, and richly flavored when first
gathered, but soon becomes dry and woolly.

An excellent early apple, suitable either for culinary purposes or
dessert use; it is ripe in the beginning of August, but may be used in
pies before then. Bretonnerie says it may be used “en compôte” in the
beginning of July, and is preferable to the Calville Rouge d’Eté.

The tree is rather a delicate grower, never attaining a large size, but
healthy and hardy, and an excellent bearer. It succeeds well as a dwarf
on the paradise or doucin stock.


260. PAWSAN.--Knight.

 IDENTIFICATION.--Pom. Heref. t. 15. Lind. Guide, 109.

Fruit, above the middle size, two inches and three quarters wide,
and two inches and a quarter high; pretty round, without angles, but
sometimes it is oval. Crown, but little hollow. Eye, small, with short
reflexed segments of the calyx. Skin, dull muddy olive-green, a good
deal reticulated with fine network. Stalk, three quarters of an inch
long, slender, causing the fruit to be pendant.

Specific gravity of the juice, 1076.

Many trees of the Pawsan are found in the south-east, or Ryland
district of Herefordshire, which have apparently stood more than a
century. Its pulp is exceedingly rich and yellow, and in some seasons
it affords cider of the finest quality. Its name cannot be traced to
any probable source.

red, and streaked with deeper red on the side next the sun. Eye,
open, with short segments, set in a shallow and plaited basin. Stalk,
half-an-inch long, inserted in a round and rather shallow cavity.
Flesh, greenish-yellow, firm, crisp, and juicy, with a rich, and brisk
sugary flavor, somewhat resembling the Nonpareil.

A most delicious little dessert apple of the first quality; it is in
use from December to March.

In some specimens of the fruit there is no red color, but altogether
green, and covered with thin brown russet.

Fruit, medium sized, three inches wide, and two inches and three
quarters deep; oblato-ovate. Skin, green at first, changing to
yellowish-green, and covered with large russety spots on the shaded
side; but with rough brown russet and a tinge of brown on the side
next the sun. Eye, closed, with long and narrow segments, set in a
round, shallow, and undulating basin. Stalk, an inch long, stout, and
straight, inserted in a wide and shallow cavity. Flesh, yellowish,
firm, crisp, juicy, sugary and brisk; with an excellent aromatic flavor.

A dessert apple of the highest excellence, either as a dessert or a
culinary fruit; it is in use from November to March.


263. PETIT JEAN.--Hort.

 IDENTIFICATION.--Hort. Soc. Cat. ed. 3, n. 581. Lind. Guide, 79. Hort.

Fruit, small; oval, and flattened at the ends. Skin, almost entirely
covered with brilliant red; but where shaded, it is pale yellow marked
with a few stripes of red. Eye, small, set in a narrow basin. Stalk,
very short, and inserted in a deep cavity. Flesh, very white and
tender, with a mild and agreeable flavor.

By some considered as a dessert apple; but of inferior quality. Mr.
Thompson thinks it may, perhaps, do for cider; it is in use from
November to March.

The tree is a very abundant bearer.

This is a Jersey apple, and has for a long period been cultivated in
the orchards of that Island. It was transmitted to the gardens of the
London Horticultural Society, by Major General Le Couteur, of Jersey,
in the year 1822.

pale yellow with a greenish tinge, which it loses as it attains
maturity; but covered with fine clear red on the side next the sun,
and strewed all over with minute russety dots and imbedded white
specks; the whole surface is covered with a bluish bloom, from which
circumstance it receives the name of Pigeon, being considered similar
to the plumage of a dove. Eye, open, with erect segments, prominently
set in a narrow and plaited basin. Stalk, very short, inserted in
a deep and russety cavity. Flesh, white, tender, soft and juicy,
pleasantly flavored, but not at all rich.

A dessert apple of second-rate quality; but excellent for all culinary
purposes; it is in use from November to January. It is necessary in
storing this apple that care should be taken to prevent fermentation,
by which its pleasant acidity is destroyed.

The tree, though vigorous in its young state, never attains a great
size. Its shoots are long, slender and downy. It is an abundant and
regular bearer.

This apple is called Pomme de Jerusalem, from, as some fancy, the core
having four cells, which are disposed in the form of a cross, but this
is not a permanent character, as they vary from three to five.

Diel erred in applying the synonymes of Knoop’s Pigeon bigarré to this
variety, which is very distinct from the Pigeonnet.

273, 274. POMEROY.

There are two very distinct varieties of apples, which, in different
parts of the country, are known by the same name of Pomeroy. The one is
that which is cultivated in Somersetshire and the West of England, and
the other is peculiar to Lancashire and the Northern counties.

The POMEROY _of Somerset_, is medium sized, two inches and three
quarters wide, and the same in height; conical. Skin, greenish-yellow,
covered with thin grey russet, on the shaded side; but orange, covered
with stripes of deep red, and marked with patches and spots of russet
on the side exposed to the sun, and strewed all over with numerous
large, dark russety dots. Eye, open, set in a round and even basin.
Stalk, short, not extending beyond the base, inserted in a round, even,
and russety cavity. Flesh, yellow, firm, crisp, juicy, sugary, and
highly flavored.

An excellent dessert apple; in use from October till December.

The POMEROY _of Lancashire_, is medium sized, two inches and three
quarters wide, and two inches and a half high; roundish, slightly
ribbed at the apex. Skin, smooth, pale yellow on the shaded side, but
clear pale red next the sun, which blends with the yellow towards the
shaded side, so as to form orange; the whole covered with russety dots.
Eye, small and closed, placed in a small and shallow basin. Stalk,
short, imbedded in an angular cavity with a swelling on one side of it,
and from which issue a few ramifications of russet. Flesh, whitish,
tender, crisp, juicy, and with a brisk flavor, a good deal like that of
the Manks Codlin.

An excellent culinary apple; in use during September and October.

The tree is healthy, hardy, and an excellent bearer, well adapted for
orchard planting, and succeeds well in almost all situations.

There are several other varieties which are cultivated under this
appellation, to which local specific names are attached; but as I
have not seen any of these, they will be found among the “additional
varieties” at the end of that portion of this work which treats on the
apple.


275. POMEWATER.--Gerard.

 IDENTIFICATION.--Ger. Herb. Park. Par. 587. Raii. Hist. ii. 1447.

Fruit, medium sized, two inches and three quarters wide, and two inches
and a half high; roundish, and narrowing a little towards the apex,
distinctly five-sided, and terminating at the crown in five prominent
ridges. Skin smooth, yellowish-green, tinged with thin brownish-red
in the shade; but covered with dark dull red on the side next the
sun. Eye, closed, placed in a rather deep and angular basin. Stalk,
stout, an inch long, inserted in a round and even cavity. Flesh,
greenish-white, firm, crisp, and pleasantly flavored.

A culinary apple; in use from December to January.

I think there is little doubt that this is the Pome Water of Gerard. It
is still grown in Lancashire, and on the borders of Cheshire, of which
county Gerard was a native, and with the fruits of which, he was, in
all probability, best acquainted.


276. PONTO PIPPIN.--Hort.

 IDENTIFICATION.--Hort. Soc. Cat. ed. 3, n. 594.

Fruit, medium sized, two inches and a half wide, and the same in
height; conical, narrow at the eye. Skin, pale greenish-yellow in the
shade; but red on the side next the sun, and strewed all over with
spots and dots of dark russet. Eye, small and closed, set in a narrow
and irregular basin. Stalk, short, set in a wide and shallow cavity.
Flesh, greenish-white, crisp, tender, juicy, sugary, with a brisk and
rich flavor.

A dessert apple, of good, though not of first-rate quality; it is in
use from November to February.


277. POPE’S APPLE.--H.

[Illustration]

Fruit, large; ovate, handsomely and regularly formed. Skin, clear
yellow, tinged with greenish patches, and strewed with dark dots;
on the side next the sun it is marked with a few faint streaks of
crimson. Eye, large and open, like that of the Blenheim Pippin, and
set in a wide and plaited basin. Stalk, short, deeply inserted in a
round cavity, which is lined with rough russet, and with an incipient
protuberance on one side of it. Flesh, yellowish, tender, crisp, sugary
and juicy, with a rich and excellent flavor.

A very valuable apple either for the dessert or culinary purposes; it
is in use from November to March.

This variety has all the properties of the Blenheim Pippin, and is much
superior to it, keeps longer, and has the great advantage of being an
early and abundant bearer.

This excellent apple is as yet but little known. I met with it in the
neighbourhood of Sittingbourne, in Kent, where it is greatly esteemed
and now extensively cultivated for the supply of the London markets.
The account I received of it was, that the original tree grew in the
garden of a cottager of the name of Pope, at Cellar Hill, in the parish
of Linstead, near Sittingbourne. It was highly prized by its owner, to
whom the crop afforded a little income, and many were the unsuccessful
applications of his neighbours for grafts of what became generally
known as _Pope’s Apple_. The proprietor of this cottage built a row
of other dwellings adjoining it, in the gardens of which there were
no fruit trees; for the sake of uniformity, and in spite of Pope’s
importunities and the offer of twenty shillings annual increase in the
rental, the tree was condemned, and cut down in 1846, at which period
it was between 50 and 60 years old. A few days after it was destroyed,
Mr. Fairbeard, a nurseryman at Green Street, procured a number of the
grafts which he was successful in propagating, and it is to him I am
indebted for this variety.


278. POWELL’S RUSSET.--Hort.

 IDENTIFICATION.--Hort. Soc. Cat. ed. 3, n. 748. Lind. Guide, 95. Rog.
 Fr. Cult. 74,

 FIGURE--Ron. Pyr. Mal. pl. xiii. f. 9.

Fruit, small, two inches wide, and an inch and three quarters high;
roundish, and regularly formed, broad and flattened at the base, and
narrowing a little towards the eye. Skin, almost entirely covered
with pale brown russet; but where any portion of the ground color is
visible, it is greenish-yellow on the shaded side, and tinged with
brown where exposed to the sun. Eye, open, placed in a round, even, and
shallow basin. Stalk, about half-an-inch long, inserted in a rather
wide, and shallow cavity. Flesh, yellow, firm, very juicy and sugary,
with a rich and highly aromatic flavor.

A dessert apple of the very first quality; it is in use from November
to February.


279. PROLIFEROUS REINETTE.--H.

Fruit, medium sized, two inches and three quarters wide, and the same
in height; oval, with ten obscure ribs, extending from the base to the
apex, where they form five small crowns. Skin, of a dull yellow ground
color, marked with small broken stripes or streaks of crimson, and
thickly covered with small russety specks. Eye, closed, placed in a
shallow, plaited, and knobbed basin. Stalk, from half-an-inch to three
quarters long, deeply inserted the whole of its length in a round and
smooth cavity. Flesh, yellowish-white, very juicy and sugary, with a
rich and brisk flavor.

A very fine, briskly flavored dessert apple; in use from October to
December.

I received this variety from the garden at Hammersmith, formerly in the
possession of the late Mr. James Lee.


280. QUEEN OF SAUCE.--H.

Fruit, large, three inches and a quarter broad, and two inches and a
half high; obtuse-ovate, broad and flat at the base, narrowing towards
the crown, and angular on the sides. Skin, greenish-yellow on the
shaded side; but on the side exposed to the sun it is flushed with red,
which is marked with broken streaks of deeper red; it is strewed all
over with patches of thin delicate russet, and large russety specks,
those round the eye being linear. Eye, open, set in a deep and angular
basin, which is russety at the base. Stalk, about a quarter of an inch
long, deeply inserted in a round cavity, which is lined with coarse
russet. Flesh, yellowish, firm, crisp, juicy and sugary, with a brisk
and pleasant flavor.

A culinary apple of first-rate quality, and not unworthy of the
dessert; it is in use from November to January.


281. RABINE.--Hort.

Fruit, above medium size, three inches and a quarter wide, and two
inches and a quarter high; roundish, and much flattened, ribbed on the
sides, and undulated round the margin of the basin of the eye. Skin,
greenish-yellow, marked with a few faint, broken streaks and freckles
of red, and strewed with grey russety dots on the shaded side; but
dark dull red, marked and mottled with stripes of deeper red, on the
side next the sun. Eye, partially open, with broad flat segments,
and placed in an angular basin. Stalk, short, inserted in a deep and
uneven cavity, from which issue a few linear markings of russet. Flesh,
yellowish, tender, crisp, very juicy and sugary, with a brisk and
pleasant flavor.

An excellent apple, suitable either for culinary purposes or for the
dessert, but more properly for the former; it is in use from October to
Christmas.

shallow, and plaited basin. Stalk, an inch long, and slender, inserted
more than half its length in a deep, round, and even cavity. Flesh,
greenish-white, tender and delicate, with a brisk and pleasant flavor.

An American apple, suitable either for the dessert or for culinary
purposes; and esteemed in its native country as a variety of first-rate
excellence; but with us of inferior quality, even as a kitchen apple;
it is in use from December to January.

Fruit, very large, four inches broad, and three inches high; roundish
and flattened, with five ribs on the sides which extend to the eye,
forming prominent ridges round the apex. Skin, yellow, marked with thin
pale russet on the shaded side; but streaked and mottled with red on
the side next the sun. Eye, closed, and deeply set in an angular basin.
Stalk, short, deeply inserted in a round, even, and regular cavity,
which is lined with russet. Flesh, yellow, firm, and of a leathery
texture, brisk and sugary, with a high flavor.

A good culinary apple; in use during September and October.

This is an old French apple which must have been long cultivated
in this country; as it is mentioned by Rea so early as 1665. It is
supposed to take its name from the village of Rembures, in Picardy,
where it is said to have been first discovered.

The tree is a strong and vigorous grower, and an abundant bearer.


284. RAVELSTON PIPPIN.--Hort.

 IDENTIFICATION.--Hort. Trans. vol. iv. p. 522. Hort. Soc. Cat. ed. 3,
 n. 622. Lind. Guide, 9.

Fruit, medium sized, two inches and three quarters wide, and two inches
and a half high; roundish, irregular in its shape, caused by several
obtuse ribs which extend into the basin of the eye, round which they
form prominent ridges. Skin, greenish-yellow, nearly covered with red
streaks, and strewed with russety dots. Eye, closed, and set in an
angular basin. Stalk, short and thick, inserted in a round cavity.
Flesh, yellow, firm, sweet, and pleasantly flavored.

A dessert apple, of such merit in Scotland as to be generally grown
against a wall; but in the south, where it has to compete with the
productions of a warmer climate, it is found to be only of second-rate
quality. Ripe in August.

Fruit, above the medium size, three inches and a quarter wide, and
three inches high; roundish, and obscurely angular on its sides. Skin,
greenish-yellow where shaded, and almost entirely covered with deep
crimson on the side exposed to the sun, the whole surface covered
with a fine delicate bloom. Eye, closed, set in a moderately deep and
somewhat irregular basin. Stalk, short, deeply inserted in a russety
cavity. Flesh, white, crisp, very juicy, sugary, briskly and pleasantly
flavored.

An early dessert apple, but only of second-rate quality. It is ripe in
August, and requires to be eaten when gathered from the tree, as it
soon becomes meally.

This variety was imported from Sweden, by William Atkinson, Esq., of
Grove End, Paddington, in 1816.

The tree does not attain a large size, but is healthy and vigorous, and
an abundant bearer.

and strewed with numerous pearly specks. Eye, small, set in a wide and
even basin. Stalk, short and slender, inserted in a small and shallow
cavity. Flesh, yellowish, firm, juicy, and highly flavored.

A dessert apple of first-rate quality; in use during October and
November.

This excellent little apple was raised by Thomas Andrew Knight, Esq.,
from the seed of the Orange Pippin impregnated with the Golden Pippin,
about the year 1800. It, and the Yellow Ingestrie, were the produce of
two pips taken from the same cell of the core. The original trees are
still in existence at Wormsley Grange, in Herefordshire.

its base, which is hollow. Stalk, slender. Crown, sunk. Eye, deep, with
a stout erect calyx. Skin, greenish-yellow on the shaded side, with
a deep rosy color where exposed to the sun, and shaded with a darker
red.--_Lindley._

The Red Must has at all periods been esteemed a good cider apple,
though the ciders lately made with it, unmixed with other apples, have
been light, and thin; and I have never found the specific gravity of
its expressed juice to exceed 1064.--_Knight._

with deeper red on the side next the sun. Eye, small, with convergent
segments, set in a rather deep basin. Stalk, short and slender. Flesh,
yellow, firm, crisp, and rather dry.

Specific gravity of the juice, 1079.

A cider apple, which at one period was unsurpassed, but now
comparatively but little cultivated.

Perhaps there is no apple which at any period created such a sensation,
and of which so much was said and written during the 17th century, as
of the Red Streak. Prose and verse were both enlisted in its favor.
It was chiefly by the writings of Evelyn it attained its greatest
celebrity. Philips, in his poem--_Cyder_, says

    “Let every tree in every garden own
    The Red Streak as supreme, whose pulpous fruit,
    With gold irradiate, and vermilion, shines
    Tempting, not fatal, as the birth of that
    Primæval, interdicted plant, that won
    Fond Eve, in hapless hour to taste, and die.
    This, of more bounteous influence, inspires
    Poetic raptures, and the lowly muse
    Kindles to loftier strains; even I, perceive
    Her sacred virtue. See! the numbers flow
    Easy, whilst, cheer’d with her nectareous juice,
    Her’s, and my country’s praises, I exalt.”

but its reputation began to decline about the beginning of the last
century, for we find Nourse saying, “As for the liquor which it yields,
it is highly esteemed for its noble colour and smell; ’tis likewise fat
and oily in the taste, but withal very windy, luscious and fulsome, and
will sooner clog the stomach than any other cider whatsoever, leaving a
waterish, raw humour upon it; so that with meals it is no way helpful,
and they who drink it, if I may judge of them by my own palate, will
find their stomachs pall’d sooner by it, than warm’d and enliven’d.”

The Red Streak seems to have originated about the beginning of the 17th
century, for Evelyn says “it was within the memory of some now living,
surnamed the Scudamore’s Crab, and then not much known save in the
neighbourhood.” It was called Scudamore’s Crab, from being extensively
planted by the first Lord Scudamore, who was son of Sir James
Scudamore, from whom Spencer is said to have taken the character of
Sir Scudamore in his “Fairie Queen.” He was born in 1600, and created
by Charles I. Baron Dromore and Viscount Scudamore. He was attending
the Duke of Buckingham when he was stabbed at Portsmouth, and was so
affected at the event that he retired into private life, and devoted
his attention to planting orchards, of which the Red-Streak formed the
principal variety. In 1634 he was sent as ambassador to France, in
which capacity he continued for four years. He was a zealous royalist
during the civil wars, and was taken prisoner by the parliament party,
while his property was destroyed, and his estate sequestered. He died
in 1671.


289. RED STREAKED RAWLING.--H.

 SYNONYME AND FIGURE.--Rawling’s Fine Redstreak. Ron. Pyr. Mal. pl. x.
 f. 2.

Fruit, large, three inches wide by two and a quarter deep; roundish,
and slightly angular. Skin, yellow, streaked with red on the shaded
side; but entirely covered with clear dark red, and striped with still
darker red on the side exposed to the sun. Eye, small and closed, set
in a narrow and plaited basin. Stalk, long and slender, inserted in a
wide and deep cavity, which is lined with russet. Flesh, yellowish,
tender, sweet, juicy and well flavored, abounding in a sweet and
pleasant juice.

A culinary apple, well adapted for sauce; it is in use from October to
Christmas.

This is an old Devonshire apple, and no doubt the _Sweet Rawling_
referred to in a communication to one of Bradley’s “Monthly Treatises,”
from which the following is an extract. “We have an apple in this
country called a Rawling, of which there is a sweet and a sour; the
sour when ripe (which is very early) is a very fair large fruit, and
of a pleasant taste, inclined to a golden color, full of narrow red
streaks; the Sweet Rawling, has the same colours but not quite so
large, and if boiled grows hard; whereas the sour becomes soft. Now
what I have to inform you of is, _viz._: I have a tree which bears both
sorts in one apple; one side of the apple is altogether sweet, the
other side sour; one side bigger than the other; and when boiled the
one side is soft, the other hard, as all sweet and sour apples are.”

crimson dots, on the side exposed to the sun. Eye, set in a wide and
plaited basin. Stalk, half-an-inch long, inserted in a russety cavity.
Flesh, yellowish-white, firm and crisp, but tender and juicy, with a
rich vinous and aromatic flavor.

A dessert apple of first-rate quality; in use from December to March.

inches and a half high; roundish-oblate, slightly angular on its sides,
and uneven round the eye. Skin, smooth, thickly covered with brown
russety spots; greenish-yellow, changing as it ripens to pale-yellow;
and sometimes tinged with red when fully exposed to the sun. Eye,
partially open, with long green segments, set in a wide, rather deep,
and, prominently plaited basin. Stalk, short, and thick, deeply
inserted in a round cavity, which is lined with greenish-grey russet.
Flesh, yellowish-white, tender, delicate, crisp and juicy, with a rich,
sugary, and musky flavor.

A dessert apple of first-rate quality; in use from November to April.
Roger Schabol says, it has been kept two years, in a cupboard excluded
from the air.

The tree is a free grower, and an abundant bearer; but subject to
canker, unless grown in light soil, and a dry and warm situation.

This is a very old French apple, varying very much in quality according
to the soil in which it is grown; but so highly esteemed in France as
to take as much precedence of all other varieties, as the Ribston and
Golden Pippin does in this country.

An apple of first-rate quality for all culinary purposes, and excellent
also for the dessert; it is in use from November to April.

The tree is a strong and vigorous grower, hardy, and an excellent
bearer; succeeds well in almost any situation.

This variety is of American origin, and was introduced to this country
by the London Horticultural Society, who received it from David Hosack,
Esq., M.D., of New York. It is extensively grown in the middle states
of America, where the Newtown Pippin does not attain perfection, and
for which it forms a good substitute.

Fruit, medium sized; roundish, and irregular in its outline, caused by
several obtuse and unequal angles on its sides. Skin, greenish-yellow,
changing as it ripens to dull yellow, and marked with broken streaks
of pale red on the shaded side; but dull red changing to clear faint
crimson, marked with streaks of deeper crimson, on the side next the
sun, and generally russety over the base. Eye, small and closed, set
in an irregular basin, which is generally netted with russet. Stalk,
half-an-inch long, slender, and generally inserted its whole length in
a round cavity, which is surrounded with russet. Flesh, yellow, firm,
crisp, rich and sugary, charged with a powerful aromatic flavor.

An apple so well known, as to require neither description nor encomium.
It is in greatest perfection during November and December; but with
good management will keep till March.

The tree is in general hardy, a vigorous grower, and a good bearer,
provided it is grown in a dry soil; but if otherwise it is almost
sure to canker. In all the southern and middle counties of England it
succeeds well as an open standard; but in the north, and in Scotland,
it requires the protection of a wall to bring it to perfection. Nicol
calls it “a universal apple for these kingdoms; it will thrive at John
O’Groat’s, while it deserves a place at Exeter or at Cork.”

There is no apple which has ever been introduced to this country, or
indigenous to it, which is more generally cultivated, more familiarly
known, or held in higher popular estimation, than the Ribston Pippin.
It has long been in existence in this country, but did not become
generally known till the end of the last century. It is not mentioned
in any of the editions of Miller’s Dictionary, or by any other author
of that period; neither was it grown in the Brompton Park nursery in
1770. In 1785 I find it was grown to the extent of a quarter of a row,
or about 25 plants; and as this supply seems to have sufficed for three
years’ demand, its merits must have been but little known. In 1788,
it extended to one row, or about one hundred plants, and three years
later to two rows; from 1791, it increased one row annually, till 1794,
when it reached five rows. From these facts we may pretty well learn
the rise and progress of its popularity. It is now in the same nursery
cultivated to the extent of about 25 rows, or 2500 plants annually.

The original tree was first discovered growing in the garden at Ribston
Hall, near Knaresborough, but how, when, or by what means it came
there, has not been satisfactorily ascertained. One account states
that about the year 1688, some apple pips were brought from Rouen and
sown at Ribston Hall, near Knaresborough; the trees then produced from
them were planted in the park, and one turned out to be the variety in
question. The original tree stood till 1810, when it was blown down
by a violent gale of wind. It was afterwards supported by stakes in a
horizontal position, and continued to produce fruit till it lingered
and died in 1835. Since then, a young shoot has been produced about
four inches below the surface of the ground, which, with proper care,
may become a tree, and thereby preserve the original of this favorite
old dessert apple. The gardener at Ribston Hall, by whom this apple was
raised, was the father of Lowe, who during the last century was the
fruit tree nurseryman at Hampton Wick.

[Illustration]

Fruit, small; roundish, narrowing towards the apex, where it is quite
flat, and covered with thin russet. Skin, greenish-yellow on the shaded
side; but brownish-red where exposed to the sun, and strewed all over
with minute russety dots. Eye, prominent, not at all depressed, and
closed with broad flat segments. Stalk, half-an-inch long, stout, and
inserted in a slight depression. Flesh, greenish, tender, crisp, sweet,
and very juicy; with a fine, brisk, poignant, and slightly perfumed
flavor, much resembling that of the Golden Pippin and Nonpareil.

A very excellent dessert apple of first-rate quality; it is in use from
December to February. The fruit is produced in clusters of sometimes
eight and ten, at the ends of the branches.

The tree is of small size and slender growth, and not a free bearer.
It is well adapted for dwarf and espalier training when grafted on the
doucin or paradise stock, in which case it also bears better than on
the crab stock.

According to Mr. Lindley this variety was grown for many years in the
old kitchen garden at Kew; and Rogers thinks it first originated in the
Turnham Green nursery, which was during a portion of the last century,
occupied by a person of the name of Robinson.


303. ROSE DE CHINA.--Hort.

 IDENTIFICATION.--Hort. Soc. Cat. ed. 3, n. 718.

Fruit, medium sized, or rather below medium size; roundish and
flattened, almost oblate, regularly formed, and without angles. Skin,
smooth and delicate, pale greenish-yellow, with a few broken streaks of
pale red, intermixed with crimson, on the side exposed to the sun, and
strewed with minute dark colored dots. Eye, partially closed, set in a
shallow and slightly plaited basin. Stalk, an inch long, very slender,
inserted in a round, deep, smooth, and funnel-shaped cavity. Flesh,
yellowish-white tinged with green, firm, crisp, and juicy, with a sweet
and pleasant flavor.

A very good, but not first-rate, dessert apple; it is in use from
November to February. This does not appear to be the “Rose Apple of
China” of Coxe, which he imported from England, and which he says is a
large oblong fruit with a short thick stalk.

Nonpareil. Skin, yellow, tinged with green on the shaded side; but
flushed with faint red on the side exposed to the sun, and covered with
thin pale brown russet, particularly round the eye and the stalk. Eye,
small and open, with erect segments, set in a narrow, round, and even
basin. Stalk, very long, inserted in a round and wide cavity. Flesh,
yellowish, crisp, tender, very juicy, brisk, and sugary, and charged
with a peculiarly rich and highly aromatic flavor.

and even basin. Stalk, an inch long, slender, inserted half its length
in a round and even cavity. Flesh, greenish-white, firm, crisp, brisk
and sugary, charged with a rich and aromatic flavor, which partakes
very much of that of the varieties known by the name of Fenouillet, or
Fennel-flavored apples.

This is one of the best dessert apples; it is in use from November to
February.

The tree is an excellent bearer, hardy, and a free grower, and succeeds
well on almost any description of soil.

This variety is of Irish origin.


306. ROUND WINTER NONESUCH.--Hort.

 IDENTIFICATION.--Hort. Soc. Cat. ed. 3, n. 491.

Fruit, large, over three inches wide, and two and a half high; roundish
and very considerably flattened, or somewhat oblate; uneven in its
outline, caused by several obtuse and unequal, though not prominent
ribs on the sides. Skin, thick and membranous, smooth, pale yellow
slightly tinged with green on the shaded side; but on the side exposed
to the sun, it is marked with broken stripes and spots of beautiful
deep crimson, thinly sprinkled all over with a few russety dots. Eye,
large and closed, so prominently set and raised above the surface as to
appear puffed up, and set on bosses. Stalk, very short, inserted in a
round funnel-shaped cavity, and not protruding beyond the base. Flesh,
greenish-white, tender, sweet, juicy, and pleasantly flavored.

A culinary apple of first-rate quality; it is in use from November to
March.

shaded side, but changing during winter to clear greenish-yellow, and
marked with traces of russet; on the side next the sun it is covered
with brownish-red and streaks of deeper red, all of which change during
winter to clear crimson strewed with many russety specks. Eye, small
and open, with broad segments which are reflexed at the tips, and set
in a wide, pretty deep, and plaited basin. Stalk, from half-an-inch
to three quarters long, inserted in a deep cavity which is lined with

The tree attains the middle size, is a free and vigorous grower, very
hardy, and an excellent bearer.

In the Horticultural Society’s Catalogue this is called the old
Pearmain, but this name is applicable to the Winter Pearmain. Rea
is the first who notices the Royal Pearmain, and he says “it is a
much bigger and better tasted apple than the common kind.” The Royal
Pearmain of some nurseries is a very different variety from this, and
will be found described under _Summer Pearmain_.

covered with russety specks. Eye, large and closed, with long broad
segments, and set in a shallow basin. Stalk, short, inserted in a wide
and shallow cavity, which is lined with russet. Flesh, yellowish,
streaked and veined with pink or lilac-red veins, firm, crisp, juicy,
and sugary, with a brisk and pleasant flavor.

An apple much esteemed in Scotland, as a first-rate variety, both for
the dessert and culinary purposes; but it does not rank so high in the
south; it is in use from November to February.

[Illustration]

Fruit, medium sized; globular, narrowing towards the apex, regularly
and handsomely shaped. Skin, yellowish on the shaded side; but covered
with red, which is streaked with deeper red, on the side next the sun;
and covered with patches of russet and large russety specks. Eye, open,
set in a shallow and even basin. Stalk, an inch or more in length,
inserted in a small round cavity, which is lined with scales of silvery
grey russet. Flesh, yellowish-white, firm, juicy, rich, and sugary.

A very excellent dessert apple, of first-rate quality; it is in use
from January to March.

The tree is hardy, a good grower, though slender in its habit; and an
excellent bearer.

The Scarlet Nonpareil, was first discovered growing in the garden of a
publican, at Esher, in Surrey, and was first cultivated by Grimwood, of
the Kensington nursery.

 FIGURES.--Pom. Mag. t. 62. Ron. Pyr. Mal. pl. viii. f. 2.

Fruit, medium sized, two inches and a half wide, and two inches and a
quarter high; conical, regularly and handsomely shaped. Skin, smooth,
tender and shining, of a rich, deep, bright crimson, on the side next
the sun; but of a paler color, intermixed with a tinge of yellow, on
the shaded side; and the whole surface sprinkled with russety dots.
Eye, half open, with long broad segments, set in a round, even, and
rather deep basin. Stalk, from three quarters to an inch long, deeply
inserted in a round, even, and funnel-shaped cavity, which is generally
russety at the insertion of the stalk. Flesh, yellowish, with a tinge
of red under the skin; tender, juicy, sugary, and vinous.

A beautiful, and handsome dessert apple, of first-rate quality; in use
from October to January.

The tree is a free and vigorous grower, attaining about the middle
size; and is an excellent bearer. It succeeds well on the paradise
stock, on which it forms a good dwarf or espalier tree. The variety
called Hood’s Seedling, seems to me to be identical with the Scarlet
Pearmain.


321. SCARLET TIFFING.--H.

Fruit, above medium size, three inches wide, and two inches and a
quarter high; roundish, inclining to oblate, and irregularly angular.
Skin, pale yellow, tinged with green on the shaded side, and round the
eye; but deep scarlet where exposed to the sun, extending in general
over the greater portion of the fruit. Eye, small and closed, set in an
irregular, ribbed, and warted basin. Stalk, fleshy, about half an inch
long, inserted in a shallow cavity. Flesh, pure white, very tender,
crisp, juicy, and pleasantly acid.

A valuable and excellent culinary apple, much grown in the orchard
districts about Lancaster. It is in use during November and December.


322. SCOTCH BRIDGET--H.

Fruit, medium sized, two inches and three quarters wide, and two
inches and a quarter high; roundish, broadest at the base, and
narrowing towards the apex, where it is rather knobbed, caused by the
terminations of the angles on the sides. Skin, smooth, greenish-yellow,
on the shaded side, and almost entirely covered with bright deep red on
the side next the sun. Eye, closed, set in an angular and warted basin.
Stalk, three quarters of an inch long, straight, thick, and stout,
inserted in a very narrow and shallow cavity. Flesh, white, tender,
soft, juicy, and briskly flavored.

An excellent culinary apple, much grown in the neighbourhood of
Lancaster; in use from October to January.


323. SCREVETON GOLDEN PIPPIN.--Hort.

 IDENTIFICATION.--Hort. Trans. iv. 218. Hort. Soc. Cat. ed. 3, n. 288.

Fruit, larger than the old Golden Pippin, and little, if at all,
inferior to it in flavor. Skin, yellowish, considerably marked with
russet. Flesh, yellow, and more tender than the old Golden Pippin.

A dessert apple of first-rate quality; raised in the garden of Sir John
Thoroton, Bart., at Screveton, in Nottinghamshire, about the year 1808.
It is in use from December to April.


324. SEEK-NO-FARTHER.--Ronalds.

 IDENTIFICATION & FIGURE.--Ron. Pyr. Mal. 45, pl. xxiii. f. 3.

[Illustration]

Fruit, medium sized; conical, or pearmain-shaped. Skin,
yellowish-green, streaked with broken patches of crimson, on the shaded
side; and strewed with grey russety dots; but covered with light red,
which is marked with crimson streaks, and covered with patches of fine
delicate russet, and numerous large, square, and stelloid russety
specks like scales, on the side exposed to the sun. Eye, small and
closed, with broad, flat, segments, the edges of which fit neatly
to each other, set in a rather deep and plaited basin. Stalk, about
half-an-inch long, stout, and inserted in a deep, round, and regular
cavity. Flesh, greenish-yellow, crisp, juicy, rich, sugary, and vinous,
charged with a pleasant aromatic flavor.

An excellent dessert apple of first-rate quality. It is in use from
November to January.

This is the true old _Seek-no-farther_.


325. SELWOOD’S REINETTE.--Rog.

 IDENTIFICATION.--Rog. Fr. Cult. 103.

Fruit, large, three inches wide, and about two inches and a half high;
round and flattened, angular on the sides, and with five prominent
plaits round the eye, which is small, open, and not at all depressed,
but rather elevated on the surface. Skin, pale green, almost entirely
covered with red, which is marked with broken stripes of darker red,
those on the shaded side being paler, and not so numerous as on the
side exposed to the sun. Stalk, about half-an-inch long, very stout,
and inserted the whole of its length in a russety cavity. Flesh,
greenish-white, tender, brisk, and pleasantly flavored.

A culinary apple, of good, but not first-rate, quality. It is in use
from December to March.

The tree is a strong and healthy grower, and an abundant bearer.

This is certainly a different variety from the Selwood’s Reinette of
the Horticultural Society’s Catalogue, which is described as being
small, pearmain-shaped, greenish-yellow, and a dessert apple. It is
however, identical with the Selwood’s Reinette of Rogers, who, as we
are informed, in his “Fruit Cultivator,” received it upwards of sixty
years ago from Messrs. Hewitt and Co., of Brompton. The tree now in
my possession, I procured as a graft from the private garden of the
late Mr. Lee, of Hammersmith; and as it has proved to be the same as
Rogers’s variety, I am induced to think that it is correct, while that
of the Horticultural Society is wrong. It was raised by a person of the
name of Selwood, of Lancaster.


326. SHAKESPERE.--M.

 IDENTIFICATION & FIGURE.--Maund Fruit. pl. 71.

Fruit, medium sized, two inches and three quarters wide, and two inches
and a half high; roundish, narrowing a little towards the eye. Skin,
dark green on the shaded side, and brownish-red on the side next the
sun, which is marked with a few broken stripes of darker red; the
whole strewed with russety dots. Eye, small, and partially open, set
in a narrow and irregular basin, which is ridged round the margin.
Stalk, short and slender, inserted in a rather deep cavity. Flesh,
greenish-yellow, firm, crisp, and juicy, with a brisk vinous flavor.

An excellent dessert apple, of first-rate quality. In use from
Christmas to April.

This variety was raised by Thomas Hunt, Esq., of Stratford-on-Avon,
from the seed of Hunt’s Duke of Gloucester, and named in honor of the
poet Shakespere.


327. SHEEP’S NOSE.--Hort.

 SYNONYMES.--Bullock’s Pippin, _Coxe View_, 125. Long Tom, _Ibid._

Fruit, large, about three inches and a half long, and about three
inches wide; conical, narrowing gradually to the crown, which is
considerably higher on one side than the other; generally with ten ribs
on the sides. Skin, smooth, yellow, and strewed with a few russety
dots. Eye, small, set in a deep, plaited basin. Stalk, short, inserted
in a deep round, and russety cavity. Flesh, yellowish-white, tender,
very juicy, and sweet.

A very good variety for culinary purposes; but chiefly used as a cider
apple in Somersetshire, where it is much grown for that purpose.


328. SHEPHERD’S FAME.--Hort.

Fruit, large, three inches and a quarter wide, and two inches and a
half high; obtuse-ovate, broad and flattened at the base, narrowing
towards the eye, with five prominent ribs on the sides, and in every
respect, very much resembling a small specimen of Emperor Alexander.
Skin, smooth, pale straw-yellow, marked with faint broken patches
of crimson, on the shaded side; but streaked with yellow and bright
crimson, on the side next the sun. Eye, open, with short, stunted
segments, placed in a deep, angular, and plaited basin. Stalk, short,
imbedded in a round, funnel-shaped cavity. Flesh, yellowish, soft, and
tender, transparent, sweet, and briskly flavored, but rather dry.

An apple of very ordinary quality, in use from October to March.


329. SIBERIAN BITTER SWEET.--Knight.

 IDENTIFICATION.--Pom. Heref. t. 23. Lind. Guide, 111. Down. Fr. Amer.
 146.

Fruit, small, and nearly globular. Eye, small, with short connivent
segments of the calyx. Stalk, short. Skin, of a bright gold color,
tinged with faint and deeper red on the sunny side. The fruit grows a
good deal in clusters, on slender wing branches.

Specific gravity of the juice, 1091.

This remarkable apple was raised by Mr. Knight from the seed of the
Yellow Siberian Crab, impregnated with the pollen of the Golden Harvey.
I cannot do better than transcribe from the Transactions of the London
Horticultural Society, Mr. Knight’s own account of this apple. “The
fruit contains much saccharine matter, with scarcely any perceptible
acid; and it in consequence affords a cider, which is perfectly free
from the harshness which in that liquid offends the palate of many, and
the constitution of more; and I believe that there is not any county in
England in which it might not be made to afford, at a moderate price,
a very wholesome and very palatable cider. This fruit differs from
all others of its species with which I am acquainted, in being always
sweet, and without acidity, even when it is more than half grown.

“When the juice is pressed from ripe, and somewhat mellow fruit,
it contains a very large portion of saccharine matter; and if a
part of the water it contains be made to evaporate in a moderately
low temperature, it affords a large quantity of a jelly of intense
sweetness, which to my palate is extremely agreeable; and which may be
employed for purposes similiar to those to which the inspissated juice
of the grape is applied in France. The jelly of the apple prepared
in the manner above described, is, I believe, capable of being kept
unchanged during a very long period in any climate; the mucilage
being preserved by the antiseptic powers of the saccharine matter,
and that being incapable of acquiring, as sugar does, a state of
crystallization. If the juice be properly filtered, the jelly will be
perfectly transparent.”

The tree is a strong and vigorous grower; a most abundant bearer, and a
perfect dreadnought to the woolly aphis.


330. SIBERIAN HARVEY.--Knight.

 IDENTIFICATION.--Pom. Heref. t. 23. Lind. Guide, 111. Hort. Soc. Cat.
 ed. 3, n. 777.

Fruit, produced in clusters, small; nearly globular. Eye, small, with
short connivent segments of the calyx. Stalk, short. Skin, of a bright
gold color, tinged with faint and deeper red on the sunny side. Juice
very sweet. Ripe in October.

Specific gravity of the juice, 1091.

A cider apple raised by T. A. Knight, Esq., and, along with the Foxley,
considered by him superior to any other varieties in cultivation. It
was produced from a seed of the Yellow Siberian Crab, fertilized with
the pollen of the Golden Harvey, the juice of this variety is most
intensely sweet, and is probably, very nearly what that of the Golden
Harvey would be in a southern climate, the original tree produced its
blossoms in the year 1807, when it first obtained the annual premium of
the Herefordshire Agricultural Society.


331. SIELY’S MIGNONNE.--Lind.

 IDENTIFICATION.--Lind. Guide, 98.

 SYNONYME.--Pride of the Ditches, _acc. Lind. Guide_.

Fruit, rather small, about one inch and three quarters deep, and the
same in diameter; almost globular, but occasionally flattened on one
side. Eye, small, with a closed calyx, placed somewhat deeply in a
rather irregularly formed narrow basin, surrounded by a few small
plaits. Stalk, half-an-inch long, slender, about one half within the
base, in a narrow cavity, and occasionally pressed towards one side
by a protuberance on the opposite one. Skin, when clear, of a bright
yellow, but mostly covered with a grey netted russet, rendering the
skin scabrous. Flesh, greenish-yellow, firm, crisp, and tender. Juice,
saccharine, highly aromatic, and of a most excellent flavor.

A dessert apple, in use from November to February.

This neat and very valuable little apple, was introduced to notice
about the beginning of the present century, by the late Mr. Andrew
Siely, of Norwich, who had it growing in his garden on the Castle
Ditches, and being a favorite with him he always called it the “Pride
of the Ditches.” The tree is a weak grower and somewhat tender. It
is therefore advisable to graft it on the doucin stock, and train it
either as a dwarf or as an espalier in a garden.--_Lindley._


332. SIR WILLIAM GIBBON’S.--Hort.

Fruit, very large, three inches and three quarters wide, and three
inches high; calville-shaped, being roundish-oblate, with several
prominent angles, which extend from the base to the apex, where they
terminate in five or six large unequal knobs. Skin, deep yellow, tinged
with green, and strewed with minute russety dots on the shaded side;
but deep crimson, streaked with dark red, on the side exposed to the
sun. Eye, open, with short ragged segments, set in a deep, wide, and
irregular basin. Stalk, very short, imbedded in a deep and angular
cavity, which is lined with russet. Flesh, yellowish-white, crisp,
juicy, and slightly acid, with a pleasant vinous flavor.

A very showy and excellent culinary apple, in use from November to
January.


333. SLEEPING BEAUTY.--H.

 SYNONYMES.--Winter Sleeping Beauty. Sleeper.

Fruit, medium sized; roundish, and somewhat flattened, slightly angular
on the sides, and undulating round the eye; in some specimens there
is an inclination to an ovate, or conical shape, in which case the
apex is narrow and even. Skin, pale straw-colored, smooth and shining,
occasionally washed on one side with delicate lively red, very thinly
sprinkled with minute russety dots. Eye, large, somewhat resembling
that of Trumpington, with broad, flat, and incurved segments, which
dove-tail, as it were, to each other, and set in a shallow, uneven, and
plaited basin. Stalk, from a quarter to half-an-inch long, slightly
fleshy, inserted in a narrow, round, and rather shallow cavity, which
is tinged with green, and lined with delicate pale brown russet. Flesh,
yellowish-white, crisp, tender, and juicy, with a fine poignant and
agreeably acid flavor.

A most excellent, and very valuable apple for all culinary purposes;
and particularly for sauce. It is in use from November till the end of
February.

The tree is a most excellent bearer, and succeeds well in almost every
situation.

This excellent apple bears such a close resemblance to Dumelow’s
Seedling, that at first sight it may be taken for that variety; from
which however, it is perfectly distinct, and may be distinguished
by the want of the characteristic russet dots on the fruit, and the
spots on the young wood of the tree. It is extensively cultivated in
Lincolnshire, for the supply of the Boston markets.


334. SMALL STALK.--H.

Fruit, medium sized, two inches and a half wide, and two inches high;
roundish, slightly angular on the sides, and knobbed at the apex. Skin,
dull greenish-yellow, with a tinge of orange on the side next the sun,
and thickly covered with redish brown dots. Eye, small, and closed
with long flat segments, and placed in an angular basin. Stalk, about
an inch long, slender, inserted in a wide and rather shallow cavity.
Flesh, white, tender, juicy, and well flavored.

A good apple for ordinary purposes, much grown about Lancaster. It is
in use during September and October.


335. SOMERSET LASTING.--Hort.

ridges round the eye. Skin, pale yellow, streaked, and dotted with a
little bright crimson, next the sun. Eye, large and open, with short
stunted segments, placed in a wide and deep basin. Stalk, short,
inserted in a wide and deep cavity, which is lined with russet. Flesh,
yellowish, tender, crisp, very juicy, with a poignant, and somewhat
harsh flavor.

A culinary apple, in use from October to February.

 FIGURE.--Ron. Pyr. Mal. pl. ii. f. 4.

Fruit, rather above medium size, two inches and three quarters broad,
and the same in height; roundish, but narrowing a little towards the
eye, and slightly ribbed on the sides. Skin, covered with a delicate
white bloom, which when rubbed off exhibits a smooth, shining, and
varnished rich deep chestnut, almost approaching to black, on the side
exposed to the sun; but on the shaded side, it is of a light orange
red, and where very much shaded quite yellow, the whole strewed with
minute dots. Eye, small, half open, with long, broad, and reflexed
segments, placed in a round and slightly angular basin. Stalk,
half-an-inch long, inserted in a deep funnel-shaped cavity. Flesh, red,
as if sopped in wine, tender, sweet, juicy, and pleasantly flavored.

A very ancient English culinary and cider apple; but perhaps more
singular than useful. It is in use from October to February.

The tree is vigorous and spreading, very hardy, an excellent bearer,
and not subject to canker.


337. SPICE APPLE.--Diel.

 IDENTIFICATION--Diel Kernobst. x. 34.

Fruit, medium sized, two inches and a half broad, and two and a quarter
high; roundish, but narrowing towards the eye. Skin, deep yellow, but
marked with broad streaks of crimson on the side next the sun. Eye,
open, with long, broad, reflexed, downy segments, set in a narrow,
shallow, and plaited basin. Stalk, short, inserted in a round cavity,
which is lined with russet. Flesh, yellow, firm, crisp, brisk, and
perfumed.

A good second-rate dessert apple, in use from November to February.

This is not the Spice Apple of the Horticultural Society’s Catalogue,
but one which was cultivated by Kirke, of Brompton, under that name,
and so described by Diel.--_See Aromatic Russet._

Skin, pale greenish-yellow, tinged with orange on the side exposed
to the sun. Eye, closed, with broad segments, and set in a narrow,
plaited basin. Stalk, short, inserted in a rather deep cavity. Flesh,
greenish-yellow, tender, juicy, sugary, brisk, and slightly perfumed.

A first-rate culinary apple. It may be used for tarts, as soon as
the fruit are the size of a walnut, and continues in use up to the
beginning of October. It received the name of Springrove Codlin, from
being first introduced by Sir Joseph Banks, Bart., who resided at
Springrove, near Hounslow, Middlesex.


340. SQUIRE’S GREENING.--H.

Fruit, about medium size; roundish and flattened, irregular in its
outline, having sometimes very prominent, unequal, and obtuse angles,
on the sides, which terminate in undulations round the eye. Skin, of a
fine clear grass-green color, which it retains till the spring, covered
with dull brownish-red where exposed to the sun, thinly strewed all
over with minute dots. Eye, small and closed, inserted in a narrow,
irregular, and plaited basin. Stalk, short and slender, inserted in a
round, narrow, and deep cavity, which is lined with rough scaly russet.
Flesh, yellowish-white, firm and crisp, with a brisk, somewhat sugary
and pleasant flavor.

A good culinary apple, and useful also as a dessert variety. It is in
use from Christmas till April or May.

This variety was raised on the property of Mrs. Squires, of Nigtoft,
near Sleaford.


341. STEAD’S KERNEL.--Knight.

 IDENTIFICATION.--Pom. Heref. t. 25. Lind. Guide, 112.

Fruit, a little turbinate, or top-shaped, somewhat resembling a quince.
Eye, small, flat, with a short truncate or covered calyx. Stalk, short.
Skin, yellow, a little reticulated with a slight greyish russet, and a
few small specks intermixed.

Specific gravity of the juice, 1074.

As a cider apple, this appears to possess great merit, combining
a slight degree of astringency, with much sweetness. It ripens in
October, and is also a good culinary apple during its season. It was
raised from seed by Daniel Stead, Esq., Brierly, near Leominster,
Herefordshire.--_Knight & Lindley._


342. STIRZAKER’S EARLY SQUARE.--H.

Fruit, below medium size; roundish, with prominent ribs which run into
the eye, forming sharp ridges at the crown. Skin, of an uniform pale
yellow, freckled and mottled, with very thin dingy brown russet on the
shaded side, and, completely covered with the same on the side next
the sun. Eye, small, half open, set in an irregular and angular basin.
Stalk, very short, imbedded in a deep cavity. Flesh, white, tender,
juicy, and pleasantly flavored.

An early apple, grown in the neighbourhood of Lancaster. It is ripe in
August, and continues in use during September.


343. STRIPED BEEFING.--H.

 SYNONYMES.--Striped Beaufin. Lind. Guide, 57.

[Illustration]

Fruit, of the largest size; beautiful and handsome, roundish, and
somewhat depressed. Skin, bright lively green, almost entirely covered
with broken streaks, and patches of fine deep red, and thickly strewed
with russety dots; in some specimens the color extends almost entirely
round the fruit. Eye, like that of the Blenheim Pippin, large and
open, with short erect ragged segments, set in a deep, irregular, and
angular basin. Flesh, yellowish, firm, crisp, juicy, and pleasantly
acid.

One of the handsomest and best culinary apples in cultivation; for
baking it is unrivalled. It is in use from October till May.

The tree is very hardy, and an excellent bearer.

This noble apple was introduced by Mr. George Lindley, who found it
growing in 1794, in the garden of William Crowe, Esq., at Lakenham
near Norwich. He measured a specimen of the fruit, and found it twelve
inches and a half in circumference, and weighing twelve ounces and
a half, avoirdupoise. It does not seem ever to have been in general
cultivation, as it is not mentioned in any of the nursery catalogues;
nor is it enumerated in that of the London Horticultural Society.
Through the kindness of George Jefferies, Esq., of Marlborough Terrace,
Kensington, who procured it from his residence in Norfolk, I had the
good fortune in 1847, to obtain grafts, which when propagated, I
distributed through several of the principal nurseries of the country,
and by this means I trust, it will become more generally known, and
universally cultivated.


344. STRIPED MONSTROUS REINETTE.--Hort.

 IDENTIFICATION.--Hort. Soc. Cat. ed. 3, p. 37. Ron. Pyr. Mal. pl.

roundish, and a little flattened, irregular in its outline, having
prominent angles on the sides, which extend from the base to the apex.
Skin, smooth, of a deep yellow-ground color, which is almost entirely
covered with pale red, and streaked with broad stripes of dark crimson.
Eye, closed, with long acuminate segments, set in a narrow, angular
basin. Stalk, an inch long, slender, deeply inserted in a round, and
russety cavity. Flesh, white, tender, juicy, and pleasantly flavored.

A culinary apple of second-rate quality. It is in use during November
and December.


345. STURMER PIPPIN.--Hort.

 IDENTIFICATION.--Hort. Soc. Cat. ed. 3, n. 808. Down. Fr. Amer, 135.
 Gard. Chron. 1847, 135.

[Illustration]

Fruit, below medium size, two inches and a quarter broad, by one
inch and three quarters high; roundish, and somewhat flattened, and
narrowing towards the apex, a good deal resembling the old Nonpariel.
Skin, of a lively green color, changing to yellowish-green, as it
attains maturity, and almost entirely covered with brown russet, with
a tinge of dull red, on the side next the sun. Eye, small, and closed,
set in a shallow, irregular, and angular basin. Stalk, three quarters
of an inch long, straight, inserted in a round, even, and russety
cavity. Flesh, yellow, firm, crisp, very juicy, with a brisk and rich
sugary flavor.

This is perhaps the most valuable dessert apple of its season, it is
of first-rate excellence; and exceedingly desirable both on account
of its delicious flavor, and arriving at perfection, at a period when
the other favorite varieties are past. It is not fit for use till the
Ribston Pippin is nearly gone, and continues long after the Nonpariel.
The period of its perfection may be fixed from February to June.

The Sturmer Pippin, was raised by Mr. Dillistone, a nurseryman at
Sturmer, near Haverhill, in Suffolk, and was obtained by impregnating
the Ribston Pippin, with the pollen of the Nonpareil.

The tree is hardy and an excellent bearer, and attains about the middle
size.


346. SUGAR AND BRANDY.--H.

Fruit, medium sized, two inches and three quarters broad at the bulge,
and the same in height; conical, and angular, with a very prominent rib
on one side, forming a high ridge at the apex, terminated at the apex,
by a number of knobs which are the continuations of the costal angles.
Skin, deep dull yellow, freckled with pale red on the shaded side,
the remaining portion entirely covered with bright orange-red. Eye,
small and closed, set in a deep and furrowed basin. Stalk, very short,
inserted in a round and shallow cavity, which is lined with rough
russet. Flesh, deep yellow, spongy, juicy, very sweet, so much so, as
to be sickly.

An apple grown about Lancashire, in use during the end of August and
September.

A culinary apple in use in October and November. This is an useful
Norfolk apple, and known in the markets by the above name. The trees
are rather small growers, but great bearers.--_Lindley._

I have never seen the Summer Broad-End, and have therefore here
introduced the description of Mr. Lindley, for the benefit of those
under whose observation it may fall.

[Illustration]

Fruit, below medium size, two inches and a quarter broad at the base,
and two inches and a quarter high; ovate, flattened at the ends. Skin,
smooth and shining, pale yellow, on the shaded side; but tinged with
orange and brownish-red on the side next the sun, and strewed over with

plaited basin. Stalk, thick, a quarter of an inch long, completely
imbedded in a moderately deep cavity, which is lined with russet.
Flesh, yellowish, firm, very juicy, with a rich, vinous, and sugary
flavor.

This is one of the most delicious summer apples, and ought to form one
of every collection, however small. It is ripe in the end of August,
and keeps about a fortnight.

The tree is a small grower, and attains about the third size. It is an
early and abundant bearer, and succeeds well when grafted on the doucin
or paradise stock. When grown on the pomme paradis of the French, it
forms a beautiful little tree, which can be successfully cultivated in
pots.

base, and tapering towards the apex. Skin, yellow, streaked all over
with large patches, and broken streaks of red, mixed with silvery
russet, strewed with numerous russety dots, and covered with large
patches of rough russet on the base. Eye, closed, half open, with
long acuminate segments, placed in a wide, shallow, and plaited
basin. Stalk, half-an-inch long, obliquely inserted under a fleshy
protuberance on one side of it, which is a permanent and distinguishing
character of this apple. Flesh, deep yellow, firm, crisp, juicy,
richly, and highly perfumed.

An excellent apple, long cultivated, and generally regarded as one
of the popular varieties of this country, it is suitable either for
culinary purposes, or the dessert, and is in use during September and
October.

The tree is a good grower, and healthy; of an upright habit of growth,
and forms a fine standard tree of the largest size. It succeeds well
grafted on the paradise stock, when it forms handsome espaliers, and
open dwarfs.

This is what in many nurseries is cultivated as the _Royal Pearmain_,
but erroneously. It is one of the oldest English varieties, being
mentioned by Parkinson, in 1629.

quarter high; oblate, even and regularly formed. Skin, of a pale
bluish-green, or verdigris color, changing as it ripens to a yellowish
tinge, and marked with dots and flakes of rough veiny russet, on the
shaded side; but deep red, which is almost obscured with rough veiny
russet on the side next the sun. Eye, open, with broad segments,
reflexed at the tips, set in a wide, shallow, and plaited basin. Stalk,
half-an-inch long, inserted in a round and deep cavity. Flesh, yellow,
firm, not very juicy, but rich and sugary.

A very excellent dessert apple, remarkable for its singular color, but
is rather void of acidity. It is in use from October to January.

inches high; very similar in form to the old Nonpariel. Skin, of a fine
lively green color, which is glossy and shining, but almost entirely
covered with patches, and reticulations of thick greyish-brown russet,
which in some parts is rough and cracked; sometimes tinged with brown
where exposed to the sun. Eye, very small, half open, with short, flat,
ovate segments, and set in a small, narrow, and rather shallow basin.
Stalk, three quarters of an inch long, inserted in a rather shallow and
russety cavity. Flesh, greenish-white, firm, crisp, sugary, and with a
very powerful yet pleasant sub-acid flavor.

An excellent culinary apple admirably adapted for sauce; but too acid
for the dessert. It is in use from January to April.

The tree is a vigorous grower, and an excellent bearer.

This variety was raised in 1807, by Thomas Netherton Parker, Esq.,
of Sweeny, in Shropshire, and twenty specimens of the fruit, were
exhibited at the London Horticultural Society, in 1820, the aggregate
weight of which, was seven pounds thirteen ounces.

Fruit, below medium size, two inches and a quarter broad, by one inch
and three quarters high; roundish-oblate. Skin, yellowish-green, but
entirely covered with brown russet, strewed with silvery grey scales;
sometimes it has a brownish tinge on the side which is exposed to the

juicy, with a rich, sugary, and very high flavor.

One of the most excellent dessert apples; it is in use from October to
February.

The tree is a free grower, hardy, and an excellent bearer; it attains
about the middle size, and is well adapted for growing as an espalier,
when grafted on the paradise stock.

This variety originated at the village of Syke House, in Yorkshire,
whence its name.

Diel’s nomenclature of the Syke House Russet, affords a good example of
the transformations the names of fruits are subject to, when translated
from one language to another; he writes it Englische Spitalsreinette,
which he translates Sik-House Apple, because as he supposed it received
this appellation, either from the briskness of its flavor being
agreeable to invalids, or from its having originated in the garden of
an hospital, He says he finds it only in Kirke’s Fruit Tree Catalogue,
_where it is erroneously printed Syke-House_!

Duhamel, and following him, almost all the French writers on pomology,

side next the sun. Eye, small and closed, set in a shallow basin.
Stalk, very short, inserted in a small, shallow cavity. Flesh,
yellowish-white, crisp, tender, sweet, and delicately perfumed.

A pretty little dessert apple, but not of first-rate quality; it is in
use from November to February.

This, as well as the preceding, was raised by James Wheeler, of
Gloucester. The original tree is still existing in the nursery of
his grandson, to whom I am much indebted for several pomological
favors. The name of “Extreme,” is supposed to have been applied to
this variety, from the circumstance of producing its fruit on the
extremities of the last year’s shoots.

[Illustration]

Fruit, medium sized, two inches and a half wide, and nearly the same
in height; roundish-ovate, or rather conical, flattened at the base,
with obtuse angles on the sides, which extend and become more prominent
and rib-like round the eye. Skin, smooth, pale yellow, with a few
faint streaks of red next the sun, and covered with a delicate white
bloom. Eye, closed, set in a narrow and plaited basin. Stalk, thick and
short, inserted in a small and very shallow cavity. Flesh, pure white,
semi-transparent, with somewhat gelatinous-like blotches, tender,
juicy, with a pleasant and refreshing flavor.

A dessert apple but not of first-rate quality; ripe in August, and the
early part of September.

The tree is a strong and vigorous grower, and an excellent bearer.

The Transparent Apple of Rogers, and the Muscovy Apple of Mortimer,
cannot be identical with this variety, for they are described by
both as winter apples; may they not be the _Russischer Glasapfel, or
Astracanischer Winterapfel_ of Diel?

Respecting this apple, a correspondent in the Gardener’s Chronicle, for
1845, has the following remark, “When at Reval many years ago, I made
particular inquiries as to the mode of cultivation of the Transparent
Apple; I learned that the soil of the apple orchards there, is almost a
pure sand, but that it is customary to add to it so much stable manure,
that half the bulk of ground may be said to consist of manure. The
friend with whom I was staying, had some of these apples at dessert;
they were transparent, not in blotches, but throughout, so that held
to the light, the pips may be seen from every part; these apples
were juicy as a peach, about the size of a large one, and of a very
agreeable flavor and texture.”

 FIGURE.--Ron. Pyr. Mal. pl. ii. f. 5.

Fruit, medium sized, two inches and a half wide, and three inches high;
oblong, broader at the base than the apex. Skin, smooth, thick and
tough, of a fine rich yellow, thinly and faintly freckled with red on
the shaded side, but covered with broken streaks and dots of darker
red, interspersed with dark brown russety dots, on the side exposed to
the sun. Eye, open, set in a shallow basin. Stalk, an inch long, fleshy
at the insertion; and inserted in an even, round, cavity. Flesh,
yellowish, tender, crisp, juicy, sugary, and pleasantly flavored.

A second-rate, but beautiful and handsome dessert apple; in perfection
the beginning of October, but towards the end of the month, becomes dry
and mealy. It is, I believe, a Scotch apple, and much grown in some
districts, particularly in Clydesdale, where it is known by the name of
_Egg Apple_, and where the fruit lasts longer, than when grown in the
warmer climate of the South.

The Lady’s Finger of Dittrich, vol. i. p. 505, is a flat apple of a
Calville shape, and must be incorrect.


381. WHITE VIRGIN.--H.

 SYNONYME.--Scotch Virgin.

Fruit, medium sized, two inches and three quarters wide, and two inches
high; oblate. Skin, smooth and shining, pale yellow, on the shaded
size; but thin orange red, streaked with deep red, on the side next the
sun, and strewed with dark dots and a few veins of russet. Eye, large
and closed, with broad ovate segments, set in a wide, shallow, and
plaited basin. Stalk, a quarter of an inch long, inserted in a narrow,
and shallow cavity. Flesh, white, soft, tender, juicy, and briskly acid.

An excellent culinary apple; in use from October to February.


382. WHITE WESTLING.--H.

Fruit, rather below medium size, two inches and a half broad at the
middle, and two inches and a half high; roundish, inclining to oval,
towards the eye; angular on the sides, and ribbed round the apex. Skin,
yellow, tinged with green, and strewed with redish-brown dots on the
shaded side; but deep yellow, with large dark-crimson spots, on the
side next the sun, and covered with russet over the base. Eye, small
and closed, set in a narrow and angular basin. Stalk, half-an-inch
long, very slender, inserted in a deep, narrow, and russety cavity.
Flesh, white, tender, sweet, and briskly flavored.

An apple of hardly second-rate quality, grown about the north-eastern
parts of Sussex; it is in use from October to Christmas.


383. WHITE WINE.--H.

Fruit, about medium size, two inches and a half broad in the middle,
and two inches and a half high; narrowing towards the apex, conical,
slightly angular on the sides, and ribbed round the eye. Skin,
greenish-yellow, strewed with russety dots on the shaded side; but
deep yellow, reticulated with fine russet, and dotted with small
russety specks on the side exposed to the sun, and with a ray of fine
lilac-purple on the base encircling the stalk. Eye, open, with long
acute segments, set in a deep and ribbed basin. Stalk, five-eights of
an inch long, downy, thick and fleshy, inserted in a round cavity,
which is lined with delicate russet. Flesh, white, firm, crisp, and
pleasantly acid.

A culinary apple much grown in the Tweedside orchards, where it is
known by the name of the _Wine Apple_; it is in use from October to
Christmas.


384. WHITMORE PIPPIN.--Forsyth.

 IDENTIFICATION.--Fors. Treat. 129. Hort. Soc. Cat. ed. 3, n. 861.
 Lind. Guide, 84.

Fruit, below medium size, two inches and a quarter wide at the base,
and the same in height, but narrowing towards the apex; conical, and
obtusely angled on the sides. Skin, pale greenish-yellow in the shade;
but with a beautiful red cheek next the sun, and very sparingly strewed
with a few minute dots. Eye, closed, set in a narrow and shallow basin.
Stalk, about half-an-inch long, inserted in a wide, round, and even
cavity. Flesh, white, tinged with green, tender, juicy, sub-acid, and
slightly sweet.

A dessert apple of second-rate quality; in use from November to April.

 New Nonesuch, _acc. Ibid._ Thorle Pippin, _Leslie & Anders, Cat._
 Thoral Pippin, _acc. Ron. Pyr. Mal._

 FIGURE.--Ron. Pyr. Mal. pl. ii. f. 3.

Fruit, below medium size, two inches and a quarter wide at the middle,
and an inch and three quarters high; oblate, handsome, and regularly
formed. Skin, smooth, shining, and glossy, almost entirely covered
with fine bright crimson, which is marked with broken streaks of
darker crimson; but on any portion which is shaded, it is of a fine
clear yellow, a little streaked with pale crimson. Eye, scarcely at
all depressed, large, half open, with broad, flat segments, which
frequently appear as if rent from each other by an over-swelling of the
fruit; and set in a very shallow basin, which is often very russety,
and deeply and coarsely cracked. Stalk, a quarter of an inch long,
inserted in a wide cavity. Flesh, yellowish-white, firm, crisp, and
very juicy, with a brisk, refreshing, and pleasant flavor.

A beautiful little summer dessert apple, of first-rate quality; ripe in
August. In the south it is but little known, but in Scotland it is to
be met with in almost every garden and orchard.

In all probability the word Thorle is a corruption of Whorle, which is
no doubt the correct name of this apple. The name is supposed to be
derived from its resemblance to the _whorle_, which was the propelling
power, or rather impetus of the spindle, when the distaff and spindle
was so much in use.


386. WICKHAM’S PEARMAIN.--H.

 SYNONYMES.--Wick Pearmain, _Hort. Soc. Cat._ ed. 3, p. 31.

Fruit, small, two inches wide, and about two inches high;
pearmain-shaped, and quite flat at the base. Skin, yellow, tinged and
dotted with red on the shaded side; but bright red on the side next
the sun, and marked with patches and specks of russet round the eye.
Eye, large and open, with long acuminate segments, reflexed, and set
in a round, even, and plaited basin. Stalk, half-an-inch long, fleshy,
inserted without any depression. Flesh, greenish-yellow, tender, crisp,
juicy, sugary, and highly flavored.

An excellent dessert apple; in use from October to December. It was
raised by a Mr. Wickham, of Wick, near Winchester. In the catalogue of
the London Horticultural Society, it is called “Wick Pearmain,” but as
the name I have adopted is that by which it is best known in Hampshire,
I prefer retaining it.


387. WINTER CODLIN.--Hort.

 IDENTIFICATION.--Hort. Soc. Cat. ed. 3, n. 170.

Fruit, very large, three inches and an eighth wide at the middle,
and three inches and a half high; conical, generally five-sided,
with prominent ribs on the sides, which extend to the apex, forming
considerable ridges round the eye. Skin, smooth, yellowish-green, and
marked with dark dots. Eye, large and open, set in a deep and very
angular basin. Stalk, half-an-inch long, inserted in a deep, smooth,
and angular cavity. Flesh, greenish-white, tender, juicy, sweet, and
sub-acid.

A fine old culinary apple of first-rate quality; in use from September
to February.

The tree is a strong, vigorous, and healthy grower, and an excellent
bearer.

the sun. Eye, open, set in a rather shallow and plaited basin. Stalk,
short, thick, and deeply inserted. Flesh, firm, crisp, and briskly acid.

A culinary apple of first-rate quality; in use from November to April.

The tree is a very strong and vigorous grower, so much so, that in its
young state, it is not a great bearer; but when grafted on the paradise
stock, it produces abundantly.

Fruit, medium sized, two inches and three quarters wide, and two inches
and a quarter high; roundish, widest at the middle, and narrowing
towards the crown, round which are a few small ridges. Skin, smooth
and shining, of a dark lively green, strewed with minute russety dots;
and with a blush of dull red where exposed to the sun. Eye, small
and closed, set in a shallow and plaited basin. Stalk, half-an-inch
long, inserted in a round cavity, which is lined with russet. Flesh,
greenish, very close in texture, brittle and juicy, with a very
poignant and pleasant acid.

A culinary apple of first-rate quality, which comes into use in
November, and has been known to last under favorable circumstances, for
two years. Dry sand is a good article to preserve it in.

The tree is very hardy, a free and good grower, and an abundant bearer.

I have not adopted here, the nomenclature of the Horticultural
Society’s Catalogue, for two reasons. First, because Winter Greening
is the previous name, and, so far as I can find, the original one. It
is also very applicable, and not subject to the same objection which
Mr. Lindley has to French Crab. Second, because there is already
in the Horticultural Society’s Catalogue, the “White Easter”--the
“Paasch Appel,” of Knoop--and the two names being so similar, may
tend to confusion, a result of already too frequent occurrence, and
most desirable to be avoided. The name Winter Greening is also more
descriptive.


390. WINTER LADING.--H.

Fruit, medium sized, two inches and three quarters wide, at the middle,
and two inches and a half high; roundish, and narrowing towards the
crown, irregularly formed, sometimes with one prominent angle on one
side. Skin, bright green, marked with patches and dots of thin russet.
Eye, closed, set in an angular basin. Stalk three quarters of an inch
long, curved, inserted in a deep, round cavity. Flesh, greenish-white,
juicy, sweet, very tender, and delicate, with a pleasant acid.

An excellent sauce apple; in use from October to Christmas. It is grown
in the north-eastern parts of Sussex, about Heathfield.


391. WINTER MAJETIN.--Lind.

 IDENTIFICATION.--Lind. in Hort. Trans. vol. iv. 68. Hort. Soc. Cat.
 ed. 3, n. 876. Lind. Guide, 58.

Fruit, medium sized; roundish-ovate, with ribs round the crown. Skin,
smooth, dark green, covered with thin dull brownish-red on the side
next the sun. Eye, small and open, set in a deep basin, which is much
furrowed and plaited. Stalk, three quarters of an inch long, slender,
inserted in a deep and narrow cavity, which is lined with russet.
Flesh, greenish-white, firm, crisp, brisk, and pleasantly flavored.

A first-rate culinary apple, bearing a considerable resemblance to the
London Pippin, but does not change to yellow color by keeping as that
variety does. It is in use from January to May.

This variety is, strictly speaking, a Norfolk apple, where it is much
grown for the local markets. It was first made public by Mr. George
Lindley, who introduced it to the notice of the London Horticultural
Society. In the “Guide to the Orchard,” it is stated that the Aphis
Lanigera or “Meally Bug,” so destructive to most of our old orchard
trees, seems to be set at defiance by the Majetin. “An old tree now
growing in a garden belonging to Mr. William Youngman, of Norwich,
which had been grafted about three feet high in the stem, has been for
many years attacked by this insect below the grafted part, but never
above it; the limbs and branches being to this day perfectly free,
although all the other trees in the same garden have been infested more
or less with it.”

The tree is a most abundant bearer.

Fruit, large, three inches and a quarter wide, and about the same in
height; of a true pearmain shape, somewhat five sided towards the
crown. Skin, smooth and shining, at first of a greenish-yellow, marked
with faint streaks of dull red on the shaded side, and entirely covered
with deep red on the side next the sun; but changes by keeping to fine
deep yellow, streaked with flesh color on the shaded side; but of a
beautiful, clear, deep red or crimson, on the side next the sun, and
strewed all over with small russety dots. Eye, large and open, with
short segments, set in a pretty deep, and prominently plaited basin.
Stalk, very short, not exceeding a quarter of an inch long, inserted
in a deep, funnel-shaped cavity, which is lined with russet. Flesh,
yellowish, firm, crisp, juicy, and sugary, with a brisk, poignant, and
very pleasant flavor.

A highly esteemed old English apple, suitable principally for culinary
purposes, but also valuable for the dessert; it is in use from December
to the end of April.

The tree attains about the middle size, is a free and healthy grower,
and an excellent bearer.

This is, I believe, the oldest existing English apple on record.
It is noticed as being cultivated in Norfolk, as early as the year
1200,--what evidence against Mr. Knight’s theory! In Blomefield’s
History of Norfolk, there is mention of a tenure in that county by
petty serjeanty, and the payment of two hundred pearmains, and four
hogsheads of cider of pearmains into the Exchequer, at the feast of St.
Michael, yearly. It is the original of all the Pearmains, a name now
applied to a great variety of apples. Much doubt has existed as to the
origin of this word, and in a communication to the Gardener’s Chronicle
for 1848, I there stated what I conceived to be its meaning. The early
forms in which it was written, will be seen from the synonymes above,
they were Pearemaine and Peare-maine. In some early historical works
of the same period, I have seen Charlemagne written _Charlemaine_, the
last portion of the word having the same termination as _Pearemaine_.
Now, Charlemagne being derived from _Carolus magnus_ there is every
probability that Pearemaine is derived from _Pyrus magnus_. The
signification therefore of Pearmain is the _Great Pear Apple_, in
allusion no doubt, to the varieties known by that name, bearing a
resemblance to the form of a pear.

Fruit, medium sized, two inches and a quarter wide, and rather more
than two inches and a half high; conical, distinctly five-sided,
with five acute angles, extending the whole length of the fruit, and
terminating at the crown in five equal, and prominent crowns. Skin,
pale-green, almost entirely covered with red, which is striped and
mottled with deeper red, and marked on the shaded side with a thin coat
of russet. Eye, small, and closed, set in a narrow and angular cavity.
Stalk, about half-an-inch long and slender, deeply inserted in a narrow
and angular cavity. Flesh, greenish-yellow, tender, soft, not very
juicy, sugary, rich, and perfumed.

A good old English apple, suitable either for the dessert or culinary
purposes; it is in use from November to May.

The Winter Quoining, is a very old English apple. I have here adopted
an orthography, different from that usually employed, because I
conceive it to be the most correct. The name is derived from the word
Coin or Quoin, the corner stones of a building, because of the angles
or corners on the sides of the fruit. Thus Rea in his Pomona says,
when speaking of this apple, “it succeeds incomparably on the paradise
apple, as the Colviele, (Calville) and all other sorts of Queenings
do,” regarding the Calville also as a Queening from the angularity of
its shape.


394. WOODCOCK.--Evelyn.

 IDENTIFICATION.--Evelyn Pom. 102. Pom. Heref. t. 10. Lind. Guide, 112.

Fruit, medium sized; of an oval shape, tapering a little towards the
crown, which is narrow. Eye, flat, with broad segments of the calyx.
Stalk, three quarters of an inch long, thick, and fleshy, and curved
inwards towards the fruit. Skin, yellow, nearly covered with a soft
red, and much deeper color on the sunny side.

Specific gravity of the juice, 1073.--_Lindley._

This is one of the oldest cider apples, and is highly commended by the
writers of the seventeenth century; but according to Mr. Knight it has
long ceased to deserve the attention of the planter. It is said that
the name of this apple, is derived from an imagined resemblance in the
form of the fruit, and fruit-stalk, in some instances, to the head
and beak of a woodcock; but Mr. Knight thinks it probable that it was
raised by a person of that name.

moderately deep and plaited basin. Stalk, slender, inserted in a rather
deep and even cavity. Flesh, yellowish, crisp, brittle, juicy, with a
rich, brisk, and perfumed flavor.

An excellent apple of first-rate quality, suitable either for culinary
or dessert use; it is in season from December to April.

This is an American apple, and originated in the state of New Jersey,
U. S.

the base and the apex, with obtuse angles on the sides, which terminate
at the crown in several prominent ridges. Skin, smooth, deep clear
yellow, with a rich golden or orange tinge, on the side next the sun,
and covered with numerous dark spots. Eye, large and open, with long
acuminate segments, placed in a deep, furrowed, and angular basin.
Stalk, short, inserted in a deep and round cavity, which is thickly
lined with russet. Flesh, yellow, tender, crisp, rich, sugary, brisk,
and aromatic.

A most valuable apple either for the dessert or culinary purposes; it
is in season during September and October.

This admirable apple was raised by T. A. Knight, Esq., and first
brought into notice in 1811. As a culinary apple it is not to be
surpassed; and even in the dessert, when well ripened, Mr. Knight
considered it closely resembled the Newtown Pippin. The tree is hardy,
healthy, a free and abundant bearer. It has been found to succeed in
every latitude of these kingdoms. Even in Rosshire, the late Sir. G.
S. McKenzie, found it to succeed well as an espalier. It ought to be
cultivated in every garden, however small.

Fruit, below medium size, two inches and a half broad, and two
inches high; oblate, even and handsomely shaped. Skin, smooth, pale
greenish-yellow in the shade; but with a dull orange blush next the
sun, and sprinkled all over with russety dots and patches of delicate
russet, particularly on the base. Eye, large and open, set in a wide,
shallow, and plaited basin. Stalk, very short, imbedded in a shallow
cavity. Flesh, yellow, tinged with green, tender, very juicy, sweet,
and richly flavored.

A valuable and delicious dessert apple of first-rate quality; in use
from December to April.

The tree is a healthy and good grower, and an excellent bearer.

This variety is said to have originated from seed saved from an
apple which Lord Craven had eaten while on his travels from France
to Holland, and which was planted at Wyken, about two miles from
Coventry. According to Mr. Lindley, the original tree, then very old,
was in existence in 1827, and presented the appearance of an old trunk,
with a strong sucker growing from its roots.

ADDITIONAL VARIETIES OF APPLES.


The following is an enumeration of apples which are known to exist in
Great Britain, but of the great majority of which I have no personal
knowledge. They are either recorded in other works on pomology, or
have been communicated to me by correspondents. The most of these
have only a local reputation, and do not possess sufficient merit to
make them attractive out of their own districts. A great number are
continental varieties, which have chiefly been introduced through the
instrumentality of the London Horticultural Society, in whose garden
they are only to be found; and many of these are worthy of being more
generally known. There are also several varieties which have come under
my notice, since the preceding part of this work was published; but of
the greater part enumerated, I have had no opportunity of seeing the
fruit; the descriptions, therefore, are either from the works in which
they are recorded, or the correspondents with whom I have communicated;
my object in supplying these additional varieties, being to furnish a
complete record of all that are known to exist in Great Britain so far
as that can be ascertained.

sometimes only a small fleshy knob, inserted in a wide, deep, and
funnel-shaped cavity, lined with russet. Flesh, beautiful white, fine,

United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope

representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any

  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project

LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE

LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the

limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
