CHAPTER I

SIGNIFICANCE OF THE CRAFTS IN THE LIFE OF A PEOPLE


There was never a time in the history of the world when each race,
each nation, each community unit, each family almost, did not possess
its craftsmen and artists. In every instance, these so-called gifted
members were by no means the least important citizens; their names
appeared again and again in the stream of tradition as wonder workers
and idols of the people. This is still true in the very midst of a
materialistic age, when money and mechanics work hand in hand to
produce the most in the least time for economic reasons, and when the
individual worships "hand-made things." They may even be poorly made
or bizarre, but "handwork" satisfies the untutored. Now it is quite
possible for the machine to produce a bit of jewelry, textile, or
woodwork--even carving--quite as pleasing as any made by hand alone,
and it is being done every day. But the machine-made article must
be produced in large quantities (duplicates) for profit, whereas the
work of hand alone is unique. There lies the reason for reverence of
"handwork." It is always individual and characteristic of the workman
in style or technique and has no duplicate; it is aristocratic. Among
the primitives, the pot, necklace, or utensil was wrought by infinite
labor, and, being valuable because unique, was embellished with all
the wealth of current symbolism. It was preserved with care and became
more valuable to succeeding generations as a tangible record of race
culture and ideals. And so down to the present time, the handiwork
of the craftsman and skilled artisan has always stood as the one
imperishable record of racial development. The degree of finish, the
intricacy of design and nicety of construction are evidences of skill
and fine tools, well-organized processes, familiarity with material and
careful apprenticeship: the pattern, color, ornament, and symbolism
point to culture, learning, and standards of taste and beauty. A crude
domestic economy, rude utensils, coarse, garish costume and of simple
construction, are characteristic of an undeveloped social order. In
fact, all the arts of both construction and expression exhibit at a
given period the degree of civilization; art products are true
historical documents. Since then through their arts and crafts it
is possible for one to know a people, does it not follow that one
entrance to sympathy with the ideals and taste of the present time
is through practice in the arts? Of course a considerable mass of
information about them can be conveyed in words, especially to adults
who have passed the formative period in life and have not the same
_work_-incentive as have children. But even the adult never really
secretes much real knowledge of the arts unless he has worked in them.
He acquires rather a veneer or artistic polish which readily loses its
lustre in even a moderately critical atmosphere: he learns artistry
and the laws pertaining thereto as he would learn the length of the
Brooklyn Bridge or the population of El Paso. He merely learns to talk
about art. But children learn primarily and solely by _doing_, and the
foundations of taste and culture need to be put down early that they
may build upon them the best possible superstructure which time and
opportunity permit.

[Illustration: The Work of Children between Ten and Eleven Years of Age]

The foregoing paragraphs will perhaps have opened the way for
questions: "What kind of knowledge is of most worth? Why do
children--practically all of them--try to make things, and what is
their choice?" And when these queries have been answered so far as may
be, do the answers possess immediate value?

At the outset it will be evident that no sort of knowledge will be of
much avail until it is put in such form that the student can use it to
advantage. Mere knowledge of any kind is inherently static--inert and
often seemingly indigestible, like green fruit and raw meat. One too
frequently meets college graduates, both men and women, equipped with
so-called education, who are economic failures. These people are full
of information, well up to date, but they seemingly cannot use it.
Their assortment of knowledge is apparently in odd mental sizes which
do not fit the machinery of practical thinking as applied to life: it
is like gold on a desert isle. What the boy and girl need and desire
is (1) a favorable introduction to the sources of information, and (2)
the key to its use. They will have to be shown simple facts and truths,
and have their mental relations and importance explained. By gradually
introducing new knowledge as occasion offers, the field of study is
sufficiently widened. Children profit little by books and tools alone:
they crave encouragement and some direct constructive criticism. In
such an atmosphere their endeavors become significant and profitable,
and the accumulated learning will be applied to business or economic
ideas which result in progressive thinking, which uses information as a
_tool_, not an end in itself.

If then the arts of a people stand as monuments to its beliefs and
ideals, an intimate understanding of some of the arts ought to
be provided for in every scheme of education both at home and in
school. The child is by nature interested in the attributes of things
associated with his life and upbringing. He wants to know about them,
how they are made, and learn their uses by means of experiment. The
elements of science, mechanics and natural phenomena, business and
household art, and finally play (which is often adult living in
miniature)--these comprise a large portion of the subject matter
which is of prime importance to children. It is just such material as
this which bids fair to serve in the future as the basis for public
school curricula, simply because of its strong appeal to youth and its
potential worth in forming the adult.

The boy makes a kite, a telegraph outfit, or sled in order to give to
his play a vestige of realism. He seeks to mold the physical world to
personal desires, as men do. Incidentally he taps the general mass of
scientific facts or data and extracts therefrom no small amount of
very real, fruitful information. The result possesses marvelously
suggestive and lasting qualities because it came through effort;
because the boy wanted above all things to see his machine or toy
_work_, _move_, or obey his guiding hand, he was willing to dig for
the necessary understanding of the problem. His study brought about
contact with numerous other lines of work which were not at the time,
perhaps, germain to the subject, but were suggestive and opened various
side lines of experiment to be considered later. Therein lies the lure
of mechanics and craft work, gardening, outdoor projects, camping,
etc.: the subject is never exhausted, the student can never "touch
bottom." There is always an unexplored path to follow up. The intensity
of interest in mechanical things and in nature is the one influence
which can hold the boy in line. Turn him loose among mechanical things
where nicety of fitting and accurate workmanship are essential and
he appreciates construction immediately, because it is clear that
_workmanship_ and _efficiency_ go hand in hand. It is very much the
same with the girl: she may not enjoy the tedium of mere sewing, but
when the sewing serves a personal end, when sewing is essential to her
greatest needs, these conditions provide the only, inevitable, sure
stimulus to ambition and effort.

The school of the past, and often that of the present, has sought to
produce the adult by fertilizing the child with arithmetic, grammar,
geography, and language. The process resulted in all kinds of crooked,
stunted, oblique growth, the greatest assortment of "sports" (to use
a horticultural term) the world has ever seen. It isn't intellectual
food the child needs most (though some is very necessary); the real
need is intensive cultivation. Within himself he possesses, like the
young plant, great potential strength and virility, enough to produce
a splendid being absolutely at one with his time and surroundings;
he simply requires the chance to use the knowledge and opportunities
which lie at hand. It is, then, the common subjects of every-day
interest--science, business, nature and the like--which are the sources
of knowledge which has greatest worth to children.[A] They are the
valuable ones because they are of the type which first attracts and
holds the child's attention; they are concrete. Through them one may
learn language and expression, because one has something worth saying.

The second question, "Why do children like to make things and what is
their choice?" in the light of what has been said practically answers
itself. Children work primarily in response to that law of nature
which urges the young to exercise their muscles, to become skilful and
accurate in movement, for the sake of self-preservation and survival.
It is another phase of the same law which makes one carry out in work,
in concrete form, the ideas which come tumbling in from all conceivable
sources. The child can only think and learn in terms of material
things. Finally, the child's interests, the things he desires to make
and do, are such as will minister to his individual or social needs,
his play and imitation, and such as will satisfy his desire to produce
articles of purpose. The need may be a temporary, minor one, but every
child is stubborn on this one point, that everything he does must lead
to utility of a sort; through such working with a purpose he in time
rises to an appreciation of beauty and other abstract qualities.

Now this complex condition of child and school and society, in
which there is seemingly so much waste--"lost motion"--has always
existed; the facts are not new ones by any means. It is a condition
where the child is always curious, inquisitive and ready to "hook
a ride" on the march of business, science and learning, but the
school sternly commands "learn these stated facts because they are
fundamental" (philosophically), while society, represented by the
parent, alternately abuses the school, which is collectively his own
institution, or spoils the child by withholding the tools for learning
easily. In the meantime the child, with the native adaptability and
hardiness of true need, thrives in barren, untoward surroundings,
and matures notwithstanding. In other words, the school and society
have always tended toward misunderstanding--toward a lack of mutual
interest. In this period of uncertainty, of educational groping, the
child is found in his leisure hours pushing along the paths which
connect most directly with life and action, shunning the beaten but
roundabout highways of custom and conservatism.

The deductions are evident and clear-cut. If one accepts the foregoing
statement of the case, and there is ample evidence in any community
of size, it will be clear that certain definite opportunities should
be opened to the boy or girl to make the most of native talent and
enthusiasm. Encourage the young business adventurer or artisan to make
the most of his chosen hobby (and to choose a hobby if he has not one
already), to systematize it, develop it, make it financially profitable
if that is the desire; but first, last and all the time to make it
a study which is intensive enough to satisfy his or her productive
ambitions. At this age (up to the high school period) the boy or girl
may not have been able to decide upon a profession or business, but
he is working toward decision, and he is the only one who can choose.
Instead of trying to select an occupation for him, father and mother
would do well to put the child at the mercy of his own resources for
amusement, recreation and business, merely lending a hand now and then
in their full development. It will preserve the freshness of youth
beyond the ordinary time of its absorption by a blasé attitude toward
the world, and lead toward a more healthy and critical kind of study
than the haphazard lonesomeness, or the destructive gang spirit of the
modern community.[B]

Perhaps it would not be amiss to indicate just how this unofficial
study may be promoted, and to name the resources of the parent for the
purpose. First of all, nine children out of ten will definitely choose
a hobby or recreation or indicate some preference, as photography,
animal pets, woodwork, electricity, drawing, sport, one or more of
the domestic arts, collecting coins, stamps, etc.; there are as many
tastes as children. The child may get his suggestion from the school
or companions. Any legitimate taste should be actively encouraged and
supplemented by books which really explain and by tools and materials
with which to use the books. If it is a shop he wants, try to give him
the use of some corner for the specific purpose so that the occupation
may be dignified according to its juvenile worth. Second, endeavor to
emphasize the economic and social significance of the work done and
urge right along some definite aim. If a boy wants a shop, or pets, see
that they are kept in condition, attended to, and if possible give some
measure of tangible return on the outlay of money and energy. Third,
connect the boy's or girl's chosen avocation with real living in every
possible manner. Girls are rather fond of those decorative arts which
contribute to artistic pleasure, and should they make experiments with
stenciling, block-printing, and the like, have them use them also in
embellishing their own rooms, the summer camp or club. Fourth, make
the child feel that a given hobby is not to be satisfied for the mere
asking. Put some limit on the money expenditure until it is clear that
the interest is genuine and honest, and that the child is either
producing results which are sincere, or acquiring real knowledge. Fifth
and last, but perhaps most important of all, support the school in its
effort to solve the problem of formal education, because the heavy
burden rests there. It is quite essential that the home give the boy
and girl every possible chance to develop along original and specific
lines at their own pace, to experiment with the world's activities in
miniature, and establish the probable trend of individual effort for
the future. But this can only supplement and point the way for the
formal training which the institution (school) gives. The school, being
democratic and dependent upon the general public for existence, takes
its cue therefrom, and creating ideals in consonance with public needs
perfects the method of reaching them. When father and mother believe
in a vigorous, efficient education, rooted deeply in the child's
fundamental attitude toward the world and its affairs, then will the
public approve and urge the proper kind of organized training. Even so,
the school cannot really educate the child--he educates himself through
the agents aforementioned--it simply organizes information and gives
the pupil access to methods of using facts and ideas.

In closing this chapter there is one more word to be said concerning
the main theme. The arts and crafts[C] of expression and construction
fulfil that precise function in the child's preliminary training
which they did in the early history of the race. They indicate just
that degree of manual skill and constructive ability of which both
the youthful individual and the young race are capable; they serve as
indices and guides to the development of design, taste and constructive
thinking. As the child matures he may elevate a given craft to an art
or science, but the early familiarity, the simple processes, he should
have, because they are essential to childhood. Hence, the large amount
of handwork in the kindergarten and primary school; it is the necessary
complement to academic work and balances the educational diet.

FOOTNOTES:

[A] For the elaboration of this question as it concerns girls see
Chapter IV.

[B] Both boys and girls have clubs, societies and organizations, which
are useless, enervating or merely harmless when they exist without
purpose. If, on the other hand, the aggregate energy can be collected
into profitable channels, these same gangs or societies are a real
source of education and training. Any organization without consistent,
sustained purpose is a waste of social energy. Baseball is worth while,
but the merits of high school fraternities are doubtful.

[C] It will be evident that the term _crafts_ as here used is a more
comprehensive term than when employed in connection with the arts and
crafts furore of the past few years. Any kind of manual occupation
may be a craft; if it involves a measure of art and science it may
become more than a craft. But with children the craft stage, which is
characteristic, includes many occupations which may not even be true
crafts as the term is ordinarily used.




CHAPTER II

THE CULTIVATION OF TASTE AND DESIGN


It will be evident to the thinking man or woman that art or any phase
of it is not to be taught successfully as a profession through books.
The very most that one can expect from reading is a knowledge about art
matters and acquaintance with the conventions and rules which obtain
therein. But even this slight result may be the precursor of a fuller,
more intimate familiarity with the principles of good taste and design.

One may be able to say "that is a beautiful room" or "a fine garden"
or "a charming gown" and yet be unable to produce any such things. How
is it possible then to _know_ if one cannot _do_? The answer is that,
_potentially_, every individual who really sees and appreciates beauty
can produce it through some form of artistic expression; the power to
execute and the power of invention are merely undeveloped. And as for
the artist or craftsman who can make beautiful things, but who cannot
explain how he does it--he is unique, like the mathematical genius;
he just sees the answer; it is a gift. Though there are born in every
generation a few with the divine spark of genius, the mass of men
and women has always learned by effort. In other words, it has been
possible to _teach_ the subjects which were found necessary to culture
and education; it is quite possible to present the ordinary phases of
art to the lay mind in such a way, even through books, that one may
have worthy ideals, and a healthy point of view. The present chapter
will be devoted to showing how books such as these[D] for boys and
girls can contribute to the development of taste.

Frankly, taste has much less to do with fine art than with the
arrangement and choice of the ordinary externals of living. Of course
fine art does in the last analysis pass judgment upon form, color
and design in clothes, furnishings and architecture, but the common
home variety of taste is derived directly from custom, comfort,
and convention, not from art at all. Only in the later stages of
refinement does the lay mind succumb to direct supervision by art.
On the other hand, all conventions and ideals are the result or sum
total of general experience, in which art has played its part, and
has left some impress on the individual, giving rise to belief in a
few principles so common as to be accepted by all. Principles of this
kind are not always serviceable or effective, because they are not
stated in precise language, and cannot therefore become standard. In
truth, so far as design is concerned, there are very few absolute rules
for guidance, and a book like "Home Decoration" cannot tell the child
or parent how to make a beautiful, inspiring home. Its mission is to
create the desire for fine surroundings, to suggest ways and means for
studying design, especially those phases of decoration associated with
the crafts, and above all such a book invites and helps to maintain a
_receptive attitude_ of mind toward artistic matters. In the effort
to produce work of merit, one becomes critical, and seeks reasons and
precedents for judgment. This is the beginning of design study: and the
fact that one has real interest in taste is indicative of the desire of
the cultured mind for ideals. If a child is allowed to grow up in the
"I know what I like" atmosphere, without reasonable contact with choice
things, and without the necessity for selection based upon reason,
there is small chance that such a child will ever acquire any sense of
fitness or taste in material surroundings.

Decoration]

The aims of all practical books for boys and girls may be summarized
about as follows:

(_a_) To absorb the overflow of youthful energy and turn it into
profitable channels.

(_b_) To develop organized thinking and accomplishment, and eliminate
wasted, aimless, non-productive action. This is the complement to
the routine of formal training in academic subjects, which are in
themselves, normally un-useful.

(_c_) To explore the field of accomplishment in order to select
intelligently a future occupation.

(_d_) To develop and foster standards and ideals of efficiency,
comfort, enjoyment, beauty and social worth. This last purpose includes
taste and is the one of concern here.

The peculiar æsthetic standards which interest young people are of
the most practical kind. They apply every day and to everybody. And
they are fundamental. The illustrations given below will indicate the
common-sense way in which design should be approached:

_Color._ The tones of the color scale have not yet been systematized so
well as those of music, but each year students of design and artists
move a little toward agreement. Now, suppose one wishes to use two
or more tones in a room, how may harmonious effect be secured? The
very word "harmony" means _agreement_, and suggests _similarity_,
_likeness_, _relationship_. Therefore the tones one would use in the
embellishment of a room should possess some common _quality_ for the
harmonizing element. Each tone having that quality as characteristic is
similar in that one respect to all other tones having the same quality.
Hence they are related in a way. The relation may be made strong or
weak by the manipulation of the bond which holds the tones together.
For instance:

Red and green are not related at all. By mixing gray with each, red and
green become related through gray. By mixing yellow, orange or blue,
etc., with red and green, the relationship may be established in the
same way.

Yellow and green have a common quality--_yellow_, and in so far tend
toward harmony. But it may not be a pleasing one, and it will be
necessary to bring them still closer together by introducing other
bonds, as gray or a color. Yellow is very light and green is dark: they
will work together better if brought nearer together in value.

almost any Girl--If She Wanted Curtains]

[Illustration: Since Flowers are so Beautiful in Themselves, is it not
Worth While to Arrange Them with Judgment?]

It is by such simple means that all color combinations are brought into
line and rendered satisfactory. No rule can be given for mixing or
choosing the actual colors, but it is a safe rule to select those of
a kind in some respect. The popular belief in low-toned (grayed) color
schemes is a sound one, and the principle can be used very comfortably
by the amateur decorator in furnishing a home. She can have any colors
she wishes, and make them pleasing, if she will unite them by some
harmonizing tone. Of course, all grays even are not rich and beautiful,
but they are better than unadulterated color. Mr. Irwin in one of his
breezy skits quotes the æsthete as saying: "Good taste should be like
the policeman at parade; he should permit the assembled colors to make
an orderly demonstration but not to start a riot." The moment the
unskilled amateur tries to use white woodwork, red wallpaper, and gilt
furniture in combination, he or she courts failure simply because the
choice lacks the pervading tone which would modify the three. There are
ways to secure harmony even under the most adverse conditions, but the
technical details are not pertinent here.

Another characteristic which stands in the way of harmony is
_emphasis_. The moment any one tone becomes greatly _different_ from
its neighbors in value or otherwise, it stands out, attracts attention,
just as in material objects, unusual, curious shapes and sizes invite
notice, often beyond their just dues. Hence a brilliant yellow house,
a bright green gown, large figured wallpaper, are over-emphatic.
Clothes, which by their color and style are loud in their clamor for
inspection, are out of key and bear the same relation to surroundings
which foreign, exotic manners and customs bear to domestic conventions.
And ordinarily one does not seek such prominence.

This question of taste is a vital one to children, and these books
about "Needlecraft," "Home Decoration," "Outdoor Work," "Gardening,"
etc., are indirectly most useful because they put the child in a
_position to choose_. The girl who sews and helps run the home is
bound to cross the path of design a dozen times a day. She is faced
with problems of arrangement, color and utility at every turn. Her own
clothes, her room, the porch and garden, whatever she touches, are
inert, lifeless things which await artistic treatment. It is when the
child is faced with the problem of personal interest and pleasure that
these elementary conceptions of design may be proposed.

_Form and Line._ Each year fashion decrees for both men and women
certain "correct" styles. At slightly longer intervals the shops offer
new models of furniture, hangings, jewelry, pottery, etc. Have these
new things been devised to meet a change in public taste? Not at all;
they are inventions to stimulate trade. Most of such productions are
out of place, incongruous, in company with present possessions. One
must have a pretty sound sense of fitness and selection in order to use
them to advantage or to resist their lure. As single examples, many of
the new things are beautiful in color and line, though they may have
nothing whatever in common with what one already owns.

One chooses a given pattern in furniture first, because of its
_utility_; second, because of its harmony in line and size with
other furniture already owned; and third, because of its intrinsic
beauty. It is much less difficult to furnish a house throughout than
to refurnish an old room in consonance with others already complete.
All the household things need not be of one kind, though the closer
one clings to a clear-cut conception of harmony (relationship of some
kind) the better the result. Hence clothes may either beautify or
exaggerate personal physique, and the garden may attach itself to the
house and grounds or stand in lonely, painful isolation. Down at bottom
design aims to assemble elements and parts into proper groups, and in
the common questions of home decorations and dress the student can
usually work on just that simple basis. It is usually the incongruous,
over-prominent, conspicuous, or isolated factor in decoration which
causes trouble.

This fragmentary discussion will perhaps suggest some of the benefit
which may come from the pursuit of crafts and occupations. The
illustrations here given are in some detail because it is so easy
to overlook design at home and in common things. Everything is so
familiar there, one is so accustomed to the furniture, rugs and their
arrangement, that it never comes to mind that the situation might be
improved. It must be remembered that, when children begin to apply
design to their own handicraft, their fundamental conceptions of beauty
originate in the home. Either the children must lose faith in home
taste, or, as they grow and learn, be allowed to bring their new-found
knowledge back into the home and "try it on." This is where the craft
does its real work. The true privilege conferred upon children by the
possession of such books as these on various special occupations is a
chance to obtain, first-hand, individual standards of perfection and
beauty. Before this they have merely accepted the home as it stood,
with no thought of what was choice or otherwise.

Since taste and design are merely implied, or indirectly included in
the several volumes, save "Home Decoration," the latter should be used
as a supplementary reference in connection with the others. As has
already been said, it is not possible or advisable to systematically
teach good taste. It will be better and more effective to just
_include_ taste in the several activities the child undertakes.
When the girl begins to make things for herself, help her to select
materials which are appropriate in every way. Have her seek materials
for the purpose. Have her _choose_ decoration and color rather than
take the first handy suggestion or copy the plans of another. She would
do well to experiment independently. The girl should create her own
room down to the last detail, not make everything herself, but plan
it, plan its arrangement, its color (tone) if possible, and make those
small decorative articles like pillows, runners, curtains, etc. But
before beginning such a comprehensive experiment in decoration have
her look about a bit and note the conditions imposed. The light and
exposure, size of the room, furniture which must be used, treatment of
hangings--these are all stubborn factors, but they respond to gradual
treatment. Then the room is hers in reality. The boy's attitude toward
taste is totally different. He cares less than the girl for the charm
of tone and arrangement; he is quite willing to despise the niceties of
decoration. He must approach the question obliquely through interest in
the efficiency of a given effort; he appreciates the utility phase of
design most of all. The boy will come to see gradually that his pets
and chickens should be decently housed, and that it is good business
to do so. He should not be allowed to impose upon his own family or
their neighbors a slovenly yard or garden. He will find that those
tools work best which are sharp and clean and always in place. His
final lesson in design grows out of association with his mates. When
he begins to go to parties, to enter the social world in a small way,
a new body of conventions in taste appear and he must be taught to
appreciate them if he would be well liked. But the real training in
design arises from manual work--the playthings, toys and utensils the
boy makes for _use_. They need not be beautiful nor is there excuse for
clumsiness in construction. One cannot expect even the mature child to
take much interest in design in the abstract, but when he meets the
subject on a common-sense basis, as a part of some personal problem,
design--even taste in color and form--acquires definite standing in his
esteem. It has earned the right. Hence a liberal contact with youthful
amusements and occupations encourages both boy and girl to build
ideals of working, and among these ideals taste is bound to appear
in some guise--usually unbidden. The book on design or decoration
is but a reference, an inspiration, a stimulant, never a text of
instruction. The ability to choose, to secure appropriate, beautiful,
accurate results, is largely a by-product of judicious reading combined
with persistent effort. It remains for the parent to skim off this
by-product as it appears and infuse a little of it into each problem
the child presents for inspection.

CHAPTER III

THE REAL GIRL

_What Is the Ideal Home?_


[Illustration: A School Garden in Jordan Harbor, Ontario, Canada. Any
Child Who has had this Experience, Who Has Produced or Helped Nature
to Produce such Wonderful Things, will be Richer in Sympathy for Fine
Things]

[Illustration: Domestic Science Class. These Girls not only Cook but
Learn about Foods, Housekeeping, Entertaining, and Themselves Keep Open
House at the School Occasionally]

Strange as it may seem, most of the plans for industrial training,
the majority of school courses of study, and probably seventy-five
per cent. of the books on the crafts and arts have been devised for
the use of boys. Now there are hosts of girls in this world, probably
as many girls as boys, and these girls are just as keen, intelligent,
ambitious and curious about things and how to make them, as are
boys. In very early childhood when both boys and girls have the same
interests, similar books of amusement are used by both. But as girls
develop the feminine point of view and need the stimulus of suggestion
and aid in creative work, the literature for them seems meagre; they
have somehow been passed by save for a manual now and then on cooking
or sewing, left as a sop to their questioning and eagerness. This state
of affairs is more than unfortunate, it is fundamentally wrong for
two very good reasons. (1) The girl up to the age of twelve or thirteen
has practically the same interests, pleasures and play instincts as
the boy. She is perhaps not so keenly alive to the charm of mechanical
things as the boy, but like all children regardless of sex, she seeks
to be a producer. She is just as much absorbed in pets and growing
things, in nature, in the current activities of her environment, and
requires the same easy outlet for her play instincts as the boy. (2)
The girl, when a woman grown, becomes the creator of the home, and too
often enters upon her domestic career with a minimum of skill or taste
in the great body of household arts, which in the aggregate, give us
the material comforts and homely pleasures. Moreover, since she, as a
girl, probably did not have the chance to satisfy her play desires and
consequently never learned to _do things_ herself, she is at a loss to
understand the never ceasing, tumultuous demands of her own children
for the opportunity to experiment. To quote Gerald Lee in the "Lost Art
of Reading," which is one of the real modern books: "The experience of
being robbed of a story we are about to read, by the good friend who
cannot help telling how it comes out, is an occasional experience in
the lives of older people, but it sums up the main sensation of life
in the career of a child. The whole existence of a boy may be said to
be a daily--almost hourly--struggle to escape being told things ...
it is doubtful if there has ever been a boy as yet worth mentioning,
who did not wish we would stand a little more to one side--let him
have it out with things. There has never been a live boy who would not
throw a store-plaything away in two or three hours for a comparatively
imperfect plaything he had made himself...."

When one goes deep enough--below the showy veneer of present-day
living--one comes to agree with Mr. Lee. The normal child, especially
the boy, is potentially a creator, a designer, discoverer, and we have
committed the everlasting sin of showing him short cuts, smoothing away
difficulties, saying "press here." No child can survive the treatment.

Father and mother have the very simple obligation to furnish the place,
raw material (books, tools, etc.), and encouragement.

[Illustration: A Children's Garden gives Fresh Air and Sunshine, and

Nature's Acquaintance]

For these reasons, if for no other, the girl ought to have a permanent
outlet for her native ingenuity and constructive skill in such crafts
and occupations as are adapted to her strength, future responsibilities
and possible interests. A home should comprise other elements
than food and clothes, which are bare necessities; and though these
may be expanded and multiplied, becoming in their preparation real
art products, they alone are deficient in interest. Look over any
well-ordered household, note the multiplicity of things it contains
which are primarily woman's possessions, and collecting all one knows
about them, the amount of real knowledge is surprisingly small. How
much does the embryo housekeeper know about textiles, curtains,
carpets, hangings, linens, brass, china, furniture? Where do all
these charming things come from? Many of the hangings, table linen,
embroidery, etc., are home products. They cannot be bought at all. The
simple stenciled curtain which one likes so much draws attention by
virtue of its personal quality. To have such things in any abundance
the girl must create them, and this she is more than willing to do.

How may one explain the restful atmosphere of certain homes
visited? How many housewives have intelligent insight concerning
home management and administration; of simple domestic chemistry or
sanitation? Yet these are vital elements in the domestic machine.
One never mistakes a proper household, orderly, smooth running for
the showy establishment--gay outside and sad inside. Even the most
untutored child unconsciously responds to the healthy influence of
selected material environment and conditions, when these are combined
harmoniously. There are systematic ways of creating pleasant rooms,
fine grounds, comfortable places for living, places imbued with the
spirit of contentment. The people who produce such places are seldom
the professional decorator, landscape architect, and hired housekeeper.
It is the woman of the family, who, having practised some of the arts,
or at least been their disciple, has learned to appreciate order
and love beauty. Therewith comes an almost instinctive knowledge of
how to use them to advantage. One can never really have beautiful
baskets, pottery, sewing, gardens, until one has made them. One surely
cannot appreciate the true worth of clean linen, a spotless house,
and perfect routine anywhere so thoroughly as in one's own house. It
naturally follows that the girl, like the boy, should be a producer,
not a mere purchaser, of personal or domestic commodities. She may
have unlimited means, but the place where she lives as a girl and the
home she seeks to create in adult life will always be impersonal,
detached, _hotel-like_, unless she personally builds it. She must know
the structure, composition, and functions of inanimate things; this
knowledge comes easiest and persists longer through use and experience.

[Illustration: All Children Love to Play at Being "Grown Up," even
Beyond the Time of Childhood. These Girls will make Real Women, because
They are Normal and Happy]

[Illustration: Girls must sometime Learn of the Conventions and Customs
of Domestic Arrangement, and too often Their Only Opportunity Lies in
such Classes as These]

There is a good bit of psychology behind the suggestions offered, and
the reasoning is simple. All our ideas, our plans, and conceptions
are just ideas and nothing more until they have been worked up into
concrete form--put to test. There is nothing tangible about an _idea_.
But living is real; hence all the details which comprise living are
real too and mere thinking about them without action is futile. One
must execute, arrange, and experiment with the raw materials of
everyday use. The result is either pleasant or otherwise; if otherwise,
the effort has somehow failed, and one should do it again and learn
thereby; if pleasant, one is the richer and happier for a bit of
success, and is warmed by the presence of mere accomplishment.

This last phrase reveals the nub of the whole question--accomplishment.
Material surroundings and comforts of course go far to make one
happy, and they are the evidence of success, but the ideal home is
also composed of people each of whom is or should be a contributor
to the work of the world. The ideal home contains no drones, and
therefore no discontent. Now the girl cannot plunge headfirst into
the maelstrom of domestic management. She must learn her strength
and acquire confidence, and there are simple occupations for early
years, occupations which train the muscles, sharpen the wits;
occupations which through suggestion gradually lead to a wider and
wider intellectual horizon, and which, by a cumulation of information
and experience, mature both judgment and taste. These occupations form,
as it were, some chapters in the unwritten grammar of culture and
efficiency whereby the girl grows in self-reliance and maturity.

There are, for instance, a number of crafts which, in their delicacy of
technique and the artistic worth of the finished product, are splendid
occupations for girls, and some few of which every girl should know.
The girl who cannot sew is an object for sympathy; it is the typical
feminine craft for the reason heretofore named--that one cannot know
how things should be unless one is familiar with the process involved.
Gowns are manufactured of pieces of cloth cut in proper shape and
sewn together in some, to the male, occult fashion, and this complex
operation only explains itself even to a woman by going through
the experience. One has always been accustomed to think that the
accomplished mistress is also an expert needle-woman or skilled worker
in textiles of some kind. Products of the needle and loom have always
been her intimate, personal possessions, and the charm of old hangings,
lace, needlecraft of all kinds, rests in the main on this personal
quality. Without a doubt the most precious belongings of the young
girl are her own room with its contents of decorations and furnishing,
and the garments which emphasize her inherent feminine charm. It is
not only a girl's right, but her duty, to maintain her place as the
embodiment of all that is fresh, cleanly and attractive. To this end
clothes and the various other products of the needle contribute not a
little; a clean-cut, thorough experience in manufacturing things for
herself is the best assurance of future taste, which will spread out
and envelop everything she touches. It is much the same with clothes
and furnishings as with other matters, what one makes is one's own,
characteristic, appropriate, adequate, with the touch of enjoyment in
it; the purchased article is devoid of sentiment, it is a makeshift and
substitute.

Then by all means let the girl learn to sew, learn to do for herself,
to study her own needs and desires, to find as she progresses, ways
to master the details of woman's own craft, and it is hoped, lay up a
store of just the sort of experience which will enable her to supervise
the work of others in her behalf when the time comes. But sewing,
valuable as it is in connection with the young girl's problems, is not
the only craft at hand. In recent years craftworkers have revived a
number of old methods of using or preparing textiles for decorative
purposes, and some of these have proven increasingly worth while in the
household. Stenciling, block-printing, dyeing, decorative darning, and
even weaving itself, since they have been remodeled and brought out in
simple form, offer opportunities to the wideawake girl. The results in
each case may be very beautiful, and perhaps more in harmony with the
individual taste and scheme of living of the particular girl than any
materials she could buy, because they may be designed and executed for
a specific place. Few people, least of all a child, work just to be
busy; there is always a motive. With the girl it is a scarf, a belt,
collar, curtain, or sofa pillow; is it not well worth while if she
can make these for herself or her room, in her chosen design motif,
(as rose, bird, tree, etc.) and color? It may be an ordinary design,
peculiar color, but they satisfy a personal sentiment which, by the
way, can be modified and improved as time goes on. One must needs allow
children to begin with the bizarre, distorted, seemingly unreasonable,
archaic desires they have and cross-fertilize these with better ones
in the hope of producing a fine, wholesome, sturdy attitude of mind.

Among the minor crafts which may be a source of real pleasure and
good taste, two are prominent: pottery and basketry. The technique,
decorative possibilities, and functions of the finished products as
elements in household economy and ornament place these crafts high in
the list of those especially suitable for girls, though boys and adults
do find them equally interesting. Pottery is so closely associated with
flowers and growing things, with the decoration of fine rooms, with
choice spots of color, and with those receptacles and utensils which
belong to the household, that it makes a strong appeal to the feminine
mind. Here is a craft which vies with textiles in age and beauty of
design, and possesses even greater charm of manipulation because it is
plastic. One can imagine no finer outlet for creative effort.

Lastly, there is the eternal, magnificent, womanly craft--home-making.
When one stops to think that the home is the one imperishable, absolute
social unit, the power which creates it must take rank with other
vital forces of constructive economics. Mothers' clubs and women's
organizations of divers kinds, or, rather, the individuals who comprise
such societies, are continually drifting into the discussion of the
worries, difficulties, and trials which attend the household. The
instant household routine becomes awkward or inadequate it affects
adversely each individual member of the family, and naturally the
mistress who is responsible shoulders a burden. There are times when
the maid leaves, or the cooking goes wrong, or the house is cold, or
just a time when one gets started for the day badly. There are times
when the innate perversity of humans and material things runs riot.
One is led to believe that such untoward occasions, since they have
been in the past, will in all likelihood continue to crop up to the
end of time, though one cannot find any good reason why they should.
There are homes unacquainted with any household rumble or squeak,
where the domestic machinery is always in order, and flexible enough
to care for sudden overloading, or absorb any reasonable shock. In
many such places, devoid of servants and confined to a modest income,
the mistress is ever an expert; the chances are that her daughters
will be equally resourceful. Really, the only sure way to bring up an
adequate number of fine, competent, resourceful wives and home-makers
is to train them definitely for the profession. The girls must be made
acquainted with every detail of the business which they will surely
inherit. The people who would live in hotels and frankly abandon
home-making themselves merely emphasize the charm of the household,
because hotels have nothing in common with homes.

It seems rather strange that a business so old as housekeeping does
not, and never has, applied to its development the laws of commercial
enterprise. When the community or corporation state sees the need for
workmen, foremen or directors, it tries to educate individuals for the
purpose. The supply of competent men and women is not left to chance.
Whereas, womankind trusts to a very fickle fortune, that every girl
will somehow learn to steer the domestic craft and be conversant with
methods of preserving family ideals. Contrast the far-sighted plans of
business to fill its ranks with the casual training the average girl
undergoes to fit her for the future. What is her chance of success? Is
it reasonable to suppose that one who has never made a home, or even
helped actively to run one made for her, can on demand "make good?" It
is a lasting tribute to the inherent genius and indefatigable patience
of the modern woman that she has achieved so much with a minimum of
experience.

Hence, in order to properly equip one's children for a practically
inevitable future, let the girls into the secret of domestic planning;
let them know of costs and shopping, income and expenditure; of
materials and uses; the care of possessions, repairs and cleaning;
try to show them that the menu is not a haphazard combination of
ingredients and foods, but a conscious selection of viands which will
entice the appetite, furnish proper nutrition and accord with the
season. By all means emphasize the fact that housekeeping, like any
business, can be systematized so that the hundred and one activities
may succeed one another in orderly procession through the weeks and
months. Wash day and housecleaning should be absorbed into the domestic
program, and never present their grisly features to the home-coming
male, with sufficient trouble of his own.

Recent issues of the magazines have contained much discussion of
the household tangle, and most of them have ended with the slogans
"industrial education," "back to the kitchen," and such. Granted
that girls need this training, and that schools in time will give
it; granted that the social position of the servant is a source
of discussion and friction; that the demands of modern living are
exacting; and, finally, granting the insistent prominence of all
the other economic disturbances, who is, in the last analysis, to
blame? Would a business man think for one moment of handing over any
department of his affairs to one not trained for the particular duties
involved? Industry in every branch seeks men and women _fitted_ to
take charge of even minor matters. And when trained assistants are
scarce the obvious policy is to prepare other promising workers for
such special places. On the other hand, mothers too often prepare
their daughters for marriage, not for home-making, seemingly blind to
the fact that marriage is an inert, barren, static condition, save
in the stimulating atmosphere of a fine home. How can the servant
question ever be settled by untutored girls who get no closer to the
domestic question than fudge, welsh rarebit and salted peanuts? The
_school can and does_ now, in all well-ordered communities, give a very
satisfactory formal, technical training in domestic art and science.[E]
There students learn to cook and sew; they learn a good deal about
food values, dietetics and simple food chemistry, simple sanitation,
etc. But the management of a real house, system and everyday routine,
that fine sense of adjustment to the conditions as they exist--these
essentials can only be learned in the home itself. The efforts of
the school can largely supplement but never replace home guidance,
experience and _responsibility_. Keeping house ought to be a science
and art rather than a game of chance.

_Definite Suggestions_

In the "Library of Work and Play," to which the present book is the
introductory volume, one will find a collection of books replete with
suggestion. But these are not manuals, or courses to be followed from
end to end, because children do not _profit most_ by such a plan.
The child is like a pebble dropped into still water. It communicates
its energy of momentum to the surrounding fluid and makes a circular
ripple, which in turn makes another and wider ripple, until the energy
is exhausted. In much the same way the child, landed in the midst of a
more or less inert material world, acts upon it with energy, _which,
however, is never exhausted_, producing the results which become more
and more extended. He begins in the middle of a given subject and works
in all possible directions, which gives one the clue to how to make the
most of books like these.[F]

If the girl has not already indicated a decided preference for
some recreation or play, place at hand the books which show the
possibilities open to her. It would be well for one to go over them
rather carefully first in order to know what they contain. Let the girl
take her leisure in searching the chapters and illustrations for the
suggestion which strikes a responsive chord. Ofttimes it will be quite
in order to point to chapters which have a bearing on some personal
need or desire. At any rate, the book or chapters which seem to be
most significant at the time should be followed up. Read over with her
such a volume as "Home Decoration" or "Housekeeping." Let her discuss
the plans offered and try them out in her own home. Every girl wants
and should have a dainty, inspiring, beautiful room of her own, and as
she grows older she also wants the rest of the house to match, so that
she can entertain her friends with pride and confidence. If one will
take "Housekeeping," "Home Decoration," and "Needlecraft" as texts,
and select from them first those suggestions which are _immediately
apt_ in a particular home, the girl will shortly find herself looking
at home problems from several different and very important angles. But
it is desirable also that the study be taken up first in a very simple
way, in order to tie it to real living and needs. New curtains, pillows
for the porch or den, stenciled scarf, the decorations and menu for a
small party, additional linen: these are some of the problems always
coming up, which may be used as a beginning. And once the start is
made the girl should have the chance to try other experiments along
the same line. Read with her the chapter on menus and marketing, or
housecleaning, and turn the house over to the daughter for a time
to manage--absolutely. There is nothing in the world which children
love more or which develops them more quickly than responsibility,
and the mutual consideration of household affairs gives the girl real
partnership in the domestic business. She may use the "Housekeeping"
book as a kind of reference, to be sought when new problems in
management fall to her share.

The question of home decoration is so vital that it deserves special
statement. The text[G] deals with all those details of interior
furnishing and embellishment which indicate taste. All of these are
not equally important, nor do they interest all girls to the same
extent, and in using the book one can profit most by the study of those
topics which touch the individual or particular family. But everywhere
there is the problem of furniture arrangement, wall decorations, color
schemes, and the skilful use of flowers, pottery and textiles. Give
the young people, and especially the girls, an insight into how the
interior should be treated. Have them look up pertinent questions in
the text and then try their 'prentice hands at creating a pleasant,
restful, homelike house with the furnishings at hand plus whatever they
can make or secure. Really, the book is as much a volume of suggestion
for the mother, to which she can refer her daughter, as a text for the
child. There is very keen interest in taste in recent years, among
young people as well as parents, and the elements hitherto lacking
have been (1) accessible information and (2) opportunity to "try it
out." Offer that opportunity; a flat is just as fruitful a field for
experiment as a house, perhaps more.

The active participation in outdoor life, nature-study propaganda
and the multiplication of popular scientific (nature) literature
has greatly opened another field to children--that of raising pets,
gardening, etc. Here the boy or girl will readily make some choice at
an early day, if there has been any contact with such things. If not,
a volume of this kind[H] will be a real stimulant and inspiration, as
it should be, not a lesson manual. Place the book in a child's hands,
help him look over the conditions, available ground, cost, care, etc.;
let him send for circulars and catalogues, or if possible visit some
one interested in the same hobby and the experiment is under way with
irresistible momentum. It is a godsend to any child to give him a
simple, direct statement of what can be done; he furnishes the steam
and imagination for future development, and father and mother comprise
the balance wheel of the business. This volume and the one on "Outdoor
Sports" contain a mass of information which touch the interests of
practically all boys and girls at some time in their first sixteen
years. When the child is old enough to launch out in any personal
undertaking, old enough for even minor responsibilities, when he or she
expresses the desire for possession and money, then give them books
like these. Let them soak in and digest. Encourage only those requests
which are convincing, but give them all the scope possible. Every child
will eventually select the pastimes which are best for her though she
may stumble in doing so; she will make fewer mistakes, and waste less
time if she have access to books which will crystallize and guide her
ambitions.

CHAPTER IV

THAT BOY

  "The prime spur to all industry (effort) was and is to own and use
  the finished product."--HALL.


One day the pedagogue, who was a learned man and addicted to study,
shut himself up in his library, bent on devising a method for training
boys into men. This master was well versed in the sciences so that he
could follow the stars in their courses, make the metals and substances
of the earth obey his will, and guide the plants in their growth from
seed to blossom. Nor was this scholar lacking in sympathy for the
arts, if they were not too fine, for his desires all led to systems
and orderly arrangements of matter, and those subjects which would not
succumb to analysis he looked upon coldly.

[Illustration: A Boy's Camp with Ernest Thompson Seton. There Was Never
a Boy Who Did Not "Make-Believe," and Here the Play Spirit, under

Appreciation of Community Effort]

[Illustration: The Play Idea very soon Grows Toward the Representation
of Primitive though Adult Customs and Actions, in which Several Join
a Common Body or Company. Hence City Gangs which Merely Seek Romantic
Expression]

Hence in this problem of education he made a careful survey of the
history and development of learning from the beginning--seeking
those ideals and standards of culture which had been approved for
the _scholar_, because scholars have always been held in high esteem
by those patrons who, being ignorant themselves, wanted scholarship
nearby. It was found in the course of his delving that the sciences
had originated and developed in about this order, mathematics,
astronomy, geology, botany, biology, etc. The arts of expression had
of course developed as a group, but chiefly through literature from
the beginning. There seemed to be a good deal of recent interest in
machines and engineering, and of course certain classes had always
tilled the soil, because one must have food; but the study of these
activities could not lead to culture, because culture had always had
to do with thinking, not manual labor. Therefore it became clear to
the master that up to the present time, since the end of all scholarly
ambition had been a profession (law, medicine, theology, etc.),
education must be a very simple matter. All one had to do was to
prepare certain capsules of mathematics, grammar, Greek and Latin, and
a few, very few, odd pellets of science, etc., and at stated intervals
stimulate the boy's mental organism with the various toxins in
rotation. Were these subjects not the very basis of culture, and what
would be more logical than direct systematic presentation of the
fundamental principles? If the patient did not respond nothing could
be done but to use more medicine, more lessons; there could be but one
line of treatment. With this question settled the good savant signified
his readiness to instruct youth in such branches as were desirable for
the educated man, and pupils came in numbers to obtain the precious
learning, for the pedagogue was favorably known as a great scholar. But
these pupils who came, like the master, happened to live in or about
the year 1912, when the chief interests of the people were business,
science, and engineering; when transportation and communication had
become highly developed and systematized; when farming and agriculture
were almost arts, the whole welfare of the nation rested on industry,
and utility held high rank as an element in culture among the people
who worked. Even when a boy of this period did not seek industrial
honors and follow in the footsteps of his father, he must needs be
interested as a citizen in so important a source of prosperity. Hence
the children who set out to become pupils of the learned teacher were
alive to the business and activities of their time and surroundings,
and were more than willing to learn when the learning led to a useful
end. But the scheme proposed by their mentor was such a queer scheme.
Of course it was better to go to school than do nothing and one must
study a few things, but how much more fascinating and worth while to
talk about birds and animals, trolley cars, the railway, electricity,
machines, and doing things with a purpose, than to discuss impossible
stories written by people who evidently knew very, very little about
young people, to learn unending pages of numbers and definitions and
facts, which, since one had no use for them, were speedily forgotten to
make room for better material?

[Illustration: A Typical Boy's Workroom and Shop. Pride of Personal
Possession Develops rather Early and the Boy Should Have a Place of His
Own]

[Illustration: The Kind of Shop which One May Have at Home]

Now these children were obedient and reverent toward learning and did
the tasks assigned them by their master, but in their leisure hours
they did a good bit of experimenting along other lines, and found
several other studies which were not in the master's scheme much more
to their taste. Animals and pets were not only nice, live, soft, downy,
fuzzy things to play with, but they had such queer ways and were so
useful that one could talk about them forever. And then if one raised
numbers of them, often neighbors would desire to purchase, and behold,
a business began whereby it was just possible one could make a profit
now and then. Again, it was fine if one had even a few tools so that
one could put together the toys and playthings _necessary_ to
every-day amusement. Of course it was needful to measure and calculate
and scheme about materials and costs, but all this scheming led to
real purpose, while the questions proposed by the teacher were just
questions after all and it couldn't make much difference whether one
found the answer or not.

Now the usual thing happened. Because of their reverence for
traditional learning and respect for its apostle the youths continued
to attend upon the master and go through the ceremonial form of
intellectual purification. But really their hearts were outside,
wrapped up in the work of the world, where they had found just the
tonics which were good for them.

In just so far as the school and home open ways which "enable the
student to earn a livelihood and to make life worth living" do we see
the passing of the old type school (suggested above) and ideal of
training. Not only are there comparatively few in this world capable
of receiving high polish through the so-called culture studies, but
the definition of culture has changed; now _any activity is cultural
which arouses one's best efforts_. Moreover, the boy of the present
is on the lookout for a new type of instructor, one born of the new
era of industrial success, a teacher who will unlock the mysteries of
modern nature, science, engineering and business, and who will make it
possible for the student to find his special abilities or bent at an
early age. It is no argument at all to say that the boy is too young
to know what is best for him, that the mature mind is the only safe
guide. The adult teacher and parent becomes a true guide only when he
uses as a basis for guidance those qualities and instincts of childhood
which cannot be smothered or eradicated. The child, whether boy or
girl, knows instinctively some of the kinds of information which do
not agree with him, because they possess no significance at the time
and he cannot assimilate and fatten on them. The child needs a new
and more nutritious mental diet. Father and mother cannot be of great
_direct_ assistance because, strange to say, they are not experts with
_children_, they merely know _a child_ (their own) passably well, but
they can provide a most effective, indirect, contributory stimulus
through outside opportunities for healthy play and experiment which
will supplement the formal instruction of the school. And children of
all ages up to the time they go to college need some strong outside
interest, or group of them, which will serve as a finder to
determine the trade, profession, or business of the future man.

only among Normal Children, chiefly Boys]

[Illustration: Pump and Waterwheel. A Type of Mechanical Problem which
the Boy May Begin With, Both In and Out of School, because It Touches
His Keenest Interest]

The children who enter the school, from whatever grade of society or
given race, are all much alike--lively little animals that sleep, eat
and talk continuously, and play, though play and expression are one
and the same. They do what all animals do--keep on the move, acquire
muscular skill and precision, and endeavor by every possible means to
express their ideas and convey them to others. This expression takes
on a constructive phase when children play at store, keeping house,
fire engine, and make toys of paper and cardboard, and such amusement
is the forerunner of that intense mechanical interest which overtakes
boys about the age of ten or eleven.[I] Girls have an equally positive
leaning which is characteristic and will be noted elsewhere. Watch
any group of boys of average parentage and surroundings and make a
list of the things they construct for themselves, for their own ends.
In any such list extending over a period of several months will be
found, according to locality, such things as wagons, sleds, whistles,
kites, dog houses, pigeon roosts, chicken coops, boats, guns, etc.,
etc. The young artisan uses whatever raw material he can; he is
chiefly concerned with the plan, and makes the best of conditions and
materials. The things he makes are always for real use, a principle
held in high esteem in all the arts. In making these toys the boy
acquires some exceedingly valuable information and a physical skill
and perfection which can only be secured at an early age. He learns
about things, about raw material, about tools and utensils common to
every household; he gets on speaking terms with the fundamental laws of
mechanics and, more than one would imagine, develops a real ingenuity
in molding material to his immediate needs. The construction of a bird
house or kite is in itself simple enough, but the boy has to spend
considerable effort in finding out how to do it, which is beneficial.
Moreover, this constant struggle to get into tune with his physical
environment and subdue it results in a considerable independence,
confidence, and resourcefulness, which under moderately favorable
conditions will produce a boy alert to the world in which he lives and
full of the spirit of investigation--the critical attitude. Such a boy
will not lean on others for either learning or pleasure.

[Illustration:

These are the Forerunners of Numerous Other Electrical Constructions,
Many of Which are Produced Out of School, in the Home Workrooms and
Shops]

Actually, however, the modern boy has not been encouraged along
these lines, nor has he been taken very seriously in those activities
which affect him most; hence his struggle toward any real efficiency. A
prominent man once said:

  "When I was fifteen years of age I could break wild horses to
  saddle or harness, and teach kicking cows to stand while they were
  being milked. I could fell trees and drop the tree in any direction
  desired. I knew the relative value of all native woods, appreciated
  the differences in soil, grains, fruits, and simple minerals. I could
  use the draw-shove, adze axe, broad axe, cross-cut saw, sickle and
  cradle. I could make a figure-four trap, an axe helve, a neck yoke,
  axe yoke, whiffletree, clevis, and could braid an eight-strand cattle
  whip. We used to mend our harness on rainy days and I could make a
  wax-end and thread it with a bristle, and use a brad-awl. I knew
  how to construct an ash-leach and to make soft-soap, apple butter,
  and pumpkin pies. I knew the process of weaving flax and wool, of
  making and burning brick. I knew on sight and had names for a score
  or more of birds, and had a good idea of the habits of squirrels,
  skunks, wolves, and the fishes that swam in the creeks. I knew how to
  cure hams, shoulders, and side-meat: to pickle beef and cover apples
  with straw and earth so that they would keep in safety through the
  most severe winter, and open up in the spring fresh and valuable. Of
  course my knowledge was not of a scientific order, and I could not
  have explained it to another, because I never knew I had it."

How many boys or girls of the present time possess anything like this
sum of _useful knowledge_--useful for the conditions in which they
live? There was a time when children had to learn in order to survive,
and now that the necessity is removed and children are simply allowed
to grow without purpose, the boy and girl inevitably lose one of the
best elements in their training unless new opportunities are opened.

It is not difficult to see how the boy's interest in construction grows
and expands; mere acquaintance with boys will furnish the data. At a
comparatively early stage the youthful experiments are naturally sifted
to a few specialties, which assume prominence either because of the
boy's reading or the type of locality in which he lives. From time to
time his interest may shift, investigating one subject after another,
always seeking the unknown avocation. The process will probably lead in
time to a more or less fitting selection of trade or profession. How
else is the boy to find himself?

After he has passed through the preliminary stages of mere play and
haphazard amusement the boy becomes conscious of the mysterious,
unusual forces of electricity; they hold even adult attention and
wonder, but the boy, being more impressionable and confident,
immediately forages for information, reads enormously, and experiments.
He takes in the whole subject with a vim and sureness that is _de
facto_ evidence of its intrinsic worth for study purposes. And in
a much shorter time than adults would require, he has mastered the
fundamental laws and is eager to put this wonderful force to work,
to make things move. He has the same attitude toward steam and gas
engines, water motors, and studies them with the same intensity
of purpose. Here are dynamic elements which appeal to the human
appreciation of _power_ and which may be harnessed, subdued. The idea
is comparable to the ancient reverence for fire, water and the storm.
Since modern science has organized engineering and mechanical knowledge
and simplified it, the student can have at his disposal just the books
and periodicals needed to unlock this storeroom of mystery; these
publications were written for the purpose. But there are several other
openings for creative effort which appeal no less strongly, and among
which both the boy and girl may choose, with complete confidence that
there will be ample room for initiative, ingenuity, and utilitarian
bias.

Every child loves to go camping, and in common with his elders reveals
the close connection with primitive life in general through the
pleasure derived from the simplicity of camp life. There in the woods,
where conveniences are few, every device and construction counts the
utmost, and its purpose is apparent. The whole spirit of such living
is more in harmony with child nature and longings than the modern city
home; it supplies the craving for physical freedom and places the boy
or girl almost entirely on his own resources. What he obtains in the
way of pleasure comes from his own efforts and is correspondingly
precious. The boy especially finds in camp just as much chance for
mechanical skill as elsewhere. Temporary furniture, utensils, cooking
conveniences, the shelter, traps, etc., are suggestive. And lastly
the unconventional, untrammeled outdoor life stands in that same
relation to the boy as it did to the savage (because boyhood is a
primitive stage); he puts forth his strongest endeavors to conquer
the elements, the climate, the earth, and growing things; to provide
himself with food and shelter--in other words, to survive as the savage
sought to survive. The idea is truly epic. No wonder the child expands
and develops under the simple responsibilities imposed, and absorbs
woodcraft with such astonishing ease. The recent extraordinary growth
of the summer camp among boys' schools, and the results suggested in
the writings of Ernest Thompson Seton, are, with the unfolding of
industrial education, two pointed examples of the shifting view of
education in the home as well as school. Probably no outside agency
will in time become so effective for good as the Boy Scouts, whose code
is based on a very primitive framework suited to boys. During a recent
visit to California, and while crossing the flat prairies of Kansas,
the writer saw a company of scouts at work. It was borne in upon the
observer that there was an organization which fitted every locality,
every climate; it appealed to _boy_, not _creed_, _social order_, time,
or _adult dogma_.

One should at least mention athletics in this connection, because of
the excellent physical benefit in both activities. Athletics, however,
contains an element which is all-important--team work. And no restraint
is so much needed, nor so cheerfully heeded for that matter, by the
restless boy and girl as a community of effort. The elimination of a
purely selfish personal point of view is very difficult to bring about
with the best of children, because they are wrapped up in their own
affairs, and nothing serves to introduce them to the rights of others
and the value of concerted action for a common good so well as sport.
The kind does not matter. Any well-conducted, clean enjoyment of this
kind develops that mental pliability and willingness to _take a part_
which is a fundamental of citizenship. Incidentally leaders arise, and
the beginnings of organization dawn. It is a great day when the boy
learns his first code of signals in the ball team!

There is one more side (at least) to the boy and girl
business--_earning money_. It is nothing short of marvelous that
this desire for personal income, however small, has not been taken
seriously. Why do children want to earn money? For the best reason in
the world, _independence_. Man's entire existence from the earliest
age down to the twentieth century has been one long struggle toward
it--toward survival. First he had to combat the elements and animals,
then his fellows, for possession of food, lands, water, raw materials,
and wives. When he found that possession of certain commodities added
to his importance and therefore comfort and safety, and especially
to his privilege, he sought wealth and its freedom. Now the boy and
girl follow stages in development toward similar independence, and
among the privileges most desired is that of money or possessions
of value. If they earn it, the amount represents so much work and
gives the coins a fixed worth which cannot be established in other
fashion. Moreover, this desire for income (rather than money) is
one characteristic of the child between the ages of thirteen and
fifteen years. His power of reasoning and organization are developing
rapidly, and it is the time when adult ideals and actions first look
attractive. The time is ever ripe for launching the boy or girl into
any avocation which holds their fancy, that they may forget their own
oblique tendencies to laziness, stubbornness, wayward action, and
selfishness; these are all characteristic of the stage. Sex changes
too play no inconsiderable part, because the boy's companions are for
a time all masculine. Business of some kind is just what he needs, and
if that business is profitable, a powerful motive is supplied. Perhaps
the keenest interest is that in nature, and most children at some time
have desired pets--chickens, rabbits, pigeons, dogs, song birds. There
is scarcely a town or city condition where some animal hobby cannot
be pursued without disturbing others' peace of mind. But it should be
looked into seriously as a business, a miniature counterpart of other
like enterprises. The disposal of personal service and products to
others brings the child in close contact with numbers of adults and
adult standards and business connections. It fosters responsibility
and places upon the child the burden of proof, to show that he is
entitled to a place as a valuable member of society. And just here it
may be well to say, even if the child does not need the money he earns,
it will be the most precious he will ever own, because since it came
through effort, it will be spent with due caution.

The vegetable and flower garden may be made to yield similar returns
and such products are always salable. In addition, every house, every
yard, every farm is in constant need of repairs, changes and care which
the alert boy or girl can furnish. The development of such odd tasks
into a business parallels the development of every large enterprise
which began in a modest way. It fosters the best of personal and civic
ideals, and tames the restless, self-conscious energy of youth into
smooth and profitable channels through which to journey in peace to a
sane maturity.

[Illustration: Excellent Examples of High School Work which is Really
Profitable. These Machines will Work and Develop Power which can be

[Illustration: A Manual Training Shop]

Is it any wonder that education is so ineffective at times? In the
light of present-day appreciation of physiology and psychology it is
increasingly clear that education has furnished an impersonal, rather
stilted system of stuffing along restricted lines for a warm-hearted,
all-inquisitive, nature-loving human animal which automatically refuses
to be nourished thereby, and forages elsewhere. Although the child's
judgment can by no means be followed concerning what is best for
him, his instincts and possible future will serve as a most excellent
guide. His early training must take into account those interests
which are most keen and lasting and use them as the framework for
instruction, and all subsequent stages of training involve a distinct
obligation to build upon this elementary foundation, with a view to
social worth. Most children will have to earn a living (the girl
usually helps by managing the home), and this necessity is preëminent.
But whether rich or otherwise, the ideal of social worth remains for
all. And the least the home can do is to nurse childhood's efforts
and experiments in play and occupation which lead finally to mature
judgment and conceptions.


_How to Use Books with Boys_

Boys probably obtain more help from books than girls do because they
are more self-reliant, more assertive and impatient. And as has
been indicated, more books have been written for boys, but the same
general method of use is common to both. The boy too finds in the book
of crafts, mechanics, science, or sport a stimulant and incentive.
He reads it much as he would a story of adventure. No matter what
his greatest enjoyments may be, the perusal of accounts of others'
juvenile activities widens the productive horizon in a way not to be
ignored, and for this reason "How to Do" books of all kinds are a
serious element in the boy's life, at a time when he is less concerned
with what to do than with how to produce something. But there is a
danger in this catholicity of interest: it may become dilettantism.
The boy may merely potter or fuss with one hobby after another, more
because he cannot supply the need for more and more information, than
because he does not care. Hence it is worth while from time to time to
add more fuel to the flame of ambition in a given direction, to provide
books and tools, a working place or shop, and open the way for progress
in some stated direction.

[Illustration: The Machine Shop. Public School, Montclair, N. J.]

[Illustration: The Study of Aeroplane Construction, Public School 77,
N. Y. City. This Toy is Full of Possibilities for the Live Boy]

[Illustration: A Successful Machine]

[Illustration: Finished Aeroplanes. Public School 77, N. Y. City]

Specifically, books like those on "Mechanics, Indoors and Out,"
"Electricity," and "Carpentry," and parts of "Outdoor Work" may be
considered as of one type. When he receives the books the boy will
spend days in absorbing their contents, maybe dreaming a bit over the
possibilities in view, and finally, by a process which will always be
unintelligible to the adult, will light upon a problem or group of them
that meets his wishes, as the kite for instance; all he needs from then
on is human sympathy with the, to him, important undertaking, and
he will gallop through all phases of the kite construction and devices,
aeroplanes, propellers, forms of motive power, probably bringing up
short at the steam or gasoline engine, which opens another chapter.
The really important item connected with the use of such books is to
keep the young mechanic on one thing at a time. A bit of judicious
questioning now and then, always aimed at a group of related problems
upon which he may be engaged, will keep his mind working connectedly.
His efforts will then be cumulative in effect. Visits to the aero park,
the museums, to the shops and technical schools, and to the local power
plants are other distinct aids which should be invoked to supplement
and emphasize reading and experiment. In some of the cities model kite
and aeroplane contests are held at regular intervals, and these put
boys on their mettle to succeed. In fact the proper way to use books
of this kind is to _let the boy use them_; let him begin in the middle
of the book and work outward or at the end and go backward, but see
that he has books which present the subject vividly, simply. Provide
him with the essential tools and materials and a place to work. About
the surest way to make a success with boys is to let them have a room
or corner of their own where they can work to their hearts' content,
where they can store their precious belongings, and where companions
may come and talk over things. Really the book is inadequate alone.
Unless one provide the opening for action, books but aggravate and
excite the mind, mockingly spur the student on to "do." Hence with the
book goes a tacit obligation to provide means and place, even the most
modest, for putting the book to test.

There is yet another phase to this use of books, and it is one which
the boy will usually meet, if the texts are adequate. It is this:
whatever the young student does best will be the result of real desire,
real personal enthusiasm. It is a fallacy to suppose that the boy
interested in tools should always put up shelves, mend the door, or
fix the fence. He will execute these tasks cheerfully, but they are
not the subject of his dreams. On the other hand, if the desire be to
earn money, to have a small business of his own, fences and shelves
and plant stands may be the most interesting things in the world to
him, because they are _means_, not _ends_. Hence the printed book is
no teacher or trainer of children, no direct guide to future vocation,
but is the very essence of inspiration, the foundation from which the
young secures nourishment for day dreams and ambitions, out of which he
patiently weaves the rich fabric of experience.

FOOTNOTE:

[I] This bias toward mechanics has already been noted by teachers and
parents, but in recent years has assumed unusual significance because
of the extraordinary development of industry. This, combined with the
researches of modern psychology and pedagogy, has introduced a new, a
powerful motive into teaching.

CHAPTER V

A HOUSE AND LOT--ESPECIALLY THE LOT


The past decade has witnessed a movement, just now taking aggressive
shape, which is unique--the interest in outdoors, nature study,
farming, summer homes, sport, and what is termed the simple life. It
is a movement filled with the greatest promise of any among the host
now claiming attention, and bids fair to soothe the tired nerves and
over-stimulated minds of a frantically industrial age. Busy men and
women, particularly the men, who once thought their affairs would
become hopelessly muddled if they were not at the desk each and every
day, now indulge in sport, farming or gardening, and horticulture.
They have become convinced of the benefits of fresh air and consequent
health, and have a calmer, more serene outlook on life as a whole. It
has become "quite proper" now to live in the "country," even though the
country is represented by a lot 40 × 100, for one may have a garden
which produces wonders even on such a lot. Indirectly, people get the
desire to fix up their homesteads, to plant hedges and vines, to have
window boxes and put on a kind of apologetic style which develops into
conscious pride ultimately. One cannot play with such an avocation long
without learning a bit more about nature in general, and without any
conscious resolution drifts into keeping chickens or pets as a kind
of pleasurable refuge from mundane things. All this activity is much
more than a fad; it points to a recurrence of the primitive instinct to
always bridge the ever-widening gaps between nature and the human, who
is merely an extra-developed animal himself. Children always possess
in a marked degree a love for outdoors, for animal life, for growing
things, and fight hard during the early years to satisfy the desire.
When they cannot achieve results at home, the surplus energy is worked
off by harrowing the neighbors. Steam will do a great deal of work when
under control, but if one allows steam to accumulate it must get off
sooner or later, and children are under steam always.

[Illustration: The Boy Who does not Love to Camp is Unique. This
Illustrates one of Ernest Thompson Seton's Camps where Boys Come in
Contact with Nature at Her Best]

[Illustration: This and Other Illustrations of Homes in This Chapter,
Show such Places as People Make when they Care about Appearances]

The adult, when he becomes a city dweller, takes his nature study
in stiff two-weeks' doses, fishing or shooting, plus all the modern
gastronomic tidbits he can carry, and accumulates a fine crop of
scientific fables and sunburn. This is not real rest, not even the
best acquaintance with nature; rather it is a sort of primitive spree,
inherited in garbled form from tradition as a seasonal necessity.
The truly fine side to the nature movement lies in its influence on
everyday living through a sound regard for what nature can do at her
best, and the resultant modification of taste in general. It is a
questionable satisfaction to make a whirlwind campaign into nature's
midst for a few short weeks, comfortably supported by the consciousness
of urban conveniences in the end, when there is the possibility of
bringing nature to our very doors, almost to the hearthstone. Nature is
complacent and excellent company when offered a suitable welcome.

The ideal home is ideal throughout--outside as well as in. There is no
vital difference between the kind of pride which demands clean linen
and that which craves beautiful lawns (to be used however), beautiful
flowers (also to be enjoyed), trees and porches for shade and rest.
The kind of nature too which really rests and enthuses one is the kind
which may be enjoyed for twelve months in the year; in other words,
gardens, grounds, and trees which belong to the climate, to the
locality, and, being hardy, commend themselves at all seasons.

[Illustration: Even the Most Beautiful House must have a Background to
Soften the Conventional Lines and Areas of Construction]

[Illustration: One should Build a House as one Builds a Reputation,
Gradually, Allowing Ideals and Execution to Expand and Develop
Together. Then the House and Grounds will Appear at Their Best]

But nature is no designer. The landscape gardener and the amateur must,
by their united efforts, bring an artistic plan to bear upon nature's
offerings, using her trees and flowers and the contour of the ground,
and create an environment which pleases. The result should not only
be fine of itself, but should furnish a proper and rich background
for the house which is the centre. There are in existence numerous
periodicals devoted to country living, farming, gardening, animals,
sports, and the special suburban problem, and also a very distinguished
library dealing with similar types. These have a surprisingly wide
circulation, probably because they are as a class guiding the public
taste in such matters instead of following it. This literature has in
a few short years uncovered a new public interest in matters allied to
nature, notably in home architecture and surroundings, and there is
distinct evidence at the present time of improvement in architectural
style. Domestic buildings are more appropriate in material and design
than ever before, and are such as seem to be in tune with the somewhat
informal suburban or village surroundings. Formerly architectural
style was imported from abroad, and with it came a certain few odd
fragments of landscape gardening, full of patterns, floral arabesques
and geometric arrangements, imitation Renaissance, urns and alert
iron dogs to guard the dooryard. One can still find houses with ugly
mansard roofs, stiff, forbidding doorways, and gloomy windows, the
whole perched high on a hill, or at least elevated above the street,
suggesting in every feature the barrenness of the artificial. It is
art at its worst. The effort was further emphasized by the consistent
designers through formal, wax-like landscape accessories, tender
budding plants, cast-iron benches and garden ornaments, which must
surely be blood kin to the modern steam radiator and art cook stove.
There was nothing human about such a place: it always suggested the
hereafter. But the new, healthy, public interests in outdoors, in a
joyous life, have banished those artificial shells and substituted a
type of dwelling which is planned for living. And the outside aspect of
the house gives one the impression that it belongs to that particular
spot, for those people for home purposes. Of course all houses are
not so successful, but one finds a good many nowadays. It was bound
to come, because when people began to study nature, to live closer to
their flowers and animals, to want green lawns and pleasant hills,
they soon sought a type of shelter which would nestle close to the
ground and look hospitable and inviting. Architecture and gardening
are more closely related than one would first imagine, and it is
questionable whether one can deal successfully with one and ignore the
other.

In previous chapters the discussion of children and their training has
touched lightly upon certain points which may well be elaborated a bit
here. Most of the child's waking hours would virtually be spent out of
doors; no house is large enough. And it was urged that these intense
outside activities would be excellent foci for most profitable study.
No yard, however restricted, is too small to accommodate some hobby
which will absorb the child's energy and aid in generating constructive
skill and judgment. The matter of pocket money is also very important
and becomes a powerful motive when properly used. But there is another
and more mature point of view concerning the home as a whole, which
should not be discarded. _Every child should learn to so respect and
value his own personal property and affairs that he will respect those
of others, neighbors for instance._ He will not do this unless his
own efforts and experiments are taken seriously, or unless his home
grounds and living are maintained at top condition, or unless he
grows to appreciate a beautiful physical environment. The lawn, the
garden, poultry house and stable ought to be in perfect trim all the
time. It is better taste to have them so, and it is good business. One
cannot succeed with raising pets or animals in unsanitary quarters,
or inadequate shelter. It will not be difficult to develop proper
ideas of taste and charm in the grounds about the house if one begins
with the boy's and girl's own business and steers that to a decent
working basis. Ragged grounds, unkempt lawns, weeds, littered porches
and hopeless, tired-looking flowers--all persistent manifestations of
neglect--leave on the youthful mind ineradicable impressions which
undermine good taste.

Most boys and girls dislike any kind of work which is mere drudgery,
and most children in these days shy at work for ends other than
their own, because they have found that they can have privileges and
amusements without responsibility or other return to their parents. The
solution lies in the restoration to the boy of a feeling of personal
responsibility and pride, restoring to him and his sister the rights
of ownership to things and privileges earned, and make the children
something other than social puppets. Make their youthful occupations
count. Among those occupations one finds a number which are equally
fascinating to both children and adults.

Probably no accessory to the home is more to be valued than the garden,
especially the flower garden. It adds so much of color and variety to
the whole scheme, and helps to bring the house into intimate relation
with the grounds. The finest gardening has probably been due to
feminine influence, and every girl can draw from practical experience
with growing things a delicacy of taste and wealth of knowledge to
apply to ends peculiarly her own. The latent intuitive feminine outlook
often remains undeveloped in these days, and no craft will preserve and
stimulate it more than gardening. There is a reaction just now against
the formal flower beds of tender plants, a patch of exotic color
dotting otherwise irreproachable lawns, though the florist would like
to keep such arrangements in fashion, for he is seldom a true artist.
But better standards of living, a fresher study of nature, a more
personal, intimate architecture, have brought into them many of the old
garden ideals where the garden belonged to the mistress of the house
and showed it. The garden has a most significant history. It has always
been a centre of family life, and among the Romans was in fact the
element about which the household revolved. Here the family rested and
visited, worked and played. The dwelling was built around it, with
living rooms which opened on its walks and fountains, bringing the
family together in the most intimate way. The early Dutch and English
colonists brought to America a similar taste for this soothing adjunct
to the home and early put into effect such garden plans as their
limited resources permitted. And always it has been the women-folk of
the community who have kept the garden alive with persistent belief
in its harmonizing influence on the family. Not infrequently the
children learned their first lessons in business, in ownership and in
responsibility, there. Gardening is one of the oldest and simplest of
crafts and may not be overlooked in seeking a pathway for youthful
energy.

Perhaps the boy or girl would rather grow fruits or berries,
vegetables, raise pigeons, keep bees--one and all are equally good.
This is the essential fact: every boy and girl should come into direct
and positive contact with some of the important natural phenomena and
life. Growing things have to be cared for, they must have food, water
and protection. One cannot play with them when one feels like it;
they need attention every day. The obligation is a pleasant one, but
nevertheless it is an obligation and gives a much needed lesson in a
way that sticks.

Any occupation around the home, if it be one which ministers either
to the pleasure, comfort or profit of individual members, is quite
likely to knit that family into a more compact group. It keeps the
children more at home. The interchange of service and advice which
brings into relief the interdependence of the individuals stimulates
this one of the important characteristics of domestic society. There
has been an indication in recent years to lay upon the schools the
entire training for manhood and womanhood. It is expected to teach
manners and ethics, to give the proper kind of academic information,
to formulate character, to even teach "nature." It is impossible to do
this. The finest character, habits of study, executive ability, and
the social attitude must be started and nursed to strength, if not to
maturity, at home. Five hours each day under incomplete authority can
accomplish little else than formal instruction. Even the beginnings
of technical and scientific training have their roots deep in these
childish hobbies which originate and flourish at home, where a deep
obligation rests upon parents to make the most of this early time.
It is a lead the school can follow, but never originate. The school
represents the average educational ideal of a given community, and when
schools are inefficient, languish and give indifferent service, it
is an excellent index of the local culture standard. Therefore, when
parents develop to their highest pitch the enthusiasms and abilities
of childhood, when they foster family life and enrich it so that every
member, particularly the younger ones, become active participants, and
feel that they too have work to contribute to the general welfare, then
and then only will the school by force of public sentiment revise its
own standards.

Sale or as Pets. To the Child this Occupation Acquires the Dignity of a

[Illustration: Two More Illustrations which will Suggest Plans for the
Future]

For reasons such as these every home should be a kind of unofficial
training school, in which the courses are mostly elective. Some outdoor
hobbies which the children will enjoy should be maintained, and, on
however small a scale, the house and grounds should be planned with
this in view. The city boy and girl will have somewhat limited choice,
but even there one can enjoy several hobbies, even in a flat. One can
at least grow things, for there are few corners, even in a city, so
dark that some plants will not flourish.

CHAPTER VI

VACATIONS, ATHLETICS, SCOUTING, CAMPING, PHOTOGRAPHY


[Illustration: Every Child, and especially the Boy, Needs Active
Outdoor Exercise. This kind has much to recommend it]

[Illustration: Organized Play (Woodcraft) under Ernest Thompson Seton]

The boy of to-day is at a real disadvantage in his struggle for
health and happiness. He is always a primitive at heart, surging in
the direction of direct physical expression, showing almost on the
surface the simplicity of savage instincts, to live close to the
earth, be outdoors, perform feats of strength and skill, hunt, fish,
camp and play at doing the essential acts of life. Through succeeding
generations society has perfected a veneer of convention which glosses
over the crudities of childish abandon, and as they (children) grow,
the polish becomes thicker and more lasting, even so as to make the
individual a "ready-to-wear" being. But at intervals, even in adults,
one finds the periodic plunge into camp and field. That vacations
do not always supply the benefit which doctors would, but cannot,
is rather the fault of brevity than of the outings themselves. Boys
can, as a rule, enjoy vacations without responsibilities, they can
have ample scope for the close acquaintanceship with the simplicities
of outdoor living. One of the first true signs of summer is the tents
and crude shelters in backyards of our suburban villages. It is the
nearest approach to a normal, sane existence the child can make. No
proper child omits to play "Indian" or "hunter" in his early years,
and no youth ever quite outgrows the keen pleasure of sleeping in the
open, companioned by the sighing of the night. One recent experience
of the writer, camping among the giant redwoods of California, where
one could before going to sleep have a last look at the stars framed
by the wondrous trees, and drift to unconsciousness to water music
in the gorge way down below, was a time never to be forgotten. It is
such experiences as these in the open which both keep and restore
one's mental balance; they breed cheerfulness and optimism, develop
friendships. And the boy is not so very particular about the place,
provided there is water and woods, some companions, and things
to do. He loves to swim and should learn. He wants to be of some
account and have a part in the camp, learn how to make camp, protect
things, prepare for weather, engineer the routine of camp life.
Probably no institution outside formal educational institutions is
likely to have more vital influence on boys of the future than the
Boy Scouts, already mentioned, a marvelous scheme to organize this
play spirit. It takes hold of the most primitive instincts in child
life, develops them to the highest pitch of efficiency, and turns
the enormous energy generated thereby into useful channels by the
simplest of devices--service. But be it noted, service for which the
need is perfectly plain. The boy gets the finest of physical training
imaginable and readily cultivates moral virtues which have been the
despair of teachers and parents.

[Illustration: More Woodcraft. Has the Boy had a Chance at this kind of
Experience?]

[Illustration: Even the Technical Processes of Photography have been
Reduced to Popular Terms]

[Illustration: In These Days Photography has become so Simplified that
every Child can Use a Camera to Advantage]

In general, the vacation cannot be more profitably spent elsewhere than
outdoors. If a boy cannot actually go into the woods, away from home
and the restrictions which modern living must of necessity impose, then
the next best thing is pastime or amusement which requires outdoors
for a setting. There is much to be said for each and every one of the
sports common at the present time, baseball, tennis, football, golf,
boating, riding--they are all good--and every healthy child will take
part in one or more. Now a book about sport can never teach a boy or
girl how to become skilful; it cannot explain the mystery of the golf
stroke or pitched curve, but it can and does awaken the spirit of
trial and test. It suggests that there is possibly a right way to
do things; to play even, if one would succeed. The book may tell of
the necessity for team work and organization, for system and regular
living, and observance of rules made by others. In other words, the
book acts through suggestion, very seldom directly; and for the same
reason that one gives children books on mechanics, sewing, pets and
gardening, that they may learn of the dignity and worth of these
occupations, so also does one recommend books of sport and games,
which surely are the more valuable when taken in all seriousness. It
is through their games, involving dependence upon the confidence in
others, that children acquire the best traits of character.

Aside from the inherent return in physical well-being derived from
amusement in the open air--one can use this kind of medicine twelve
months in the year--such pastime possesses a second quality of no mean
importance; it brings one, ofttimes unconsciously, into communication
or hailing distance at least of that nature which is so charming. It is
easy to see the beauties of birds and flowers and skies, in camp; and
the dynamic loveliness of crisp fall weather, even in a great city, is
evidenced out of doors by the animation of passersby. But one cannot
read about the beauties of beneficent nature; one must enjoy them
personally, and is led on to do so through those pastimes which take
place in the open. Several of these have been mentioned, and there is
one other: photography.

Photography has almost ceased to be a science; it is a habit. One
goes to the store, invests in a comfortably small parcel and a book
of instructions which says "press here," and that is about all. The
fine succeeding details are minor matters. Whether one merely "presses
the button" or goes the whole road and really makes the picture,
photography has come to be a regular accessory to sport and enjoyment.
No doubt it is evidence of human vanity, but it takes so mild a form
and is the source of so much pleasure that the world needs it, to
preserve the thousand and one scenes and incidents which comprise the
background of life.

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
  www.gutenberg.org/license.

electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the

copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included

from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without

Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any

distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided

     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
