ACT I.


(Sitting-room of the DeSmythe home; "confusion worse confounded;"
everything topsy-turvy. Mrs. DeSmythe on couch; Madam Sateene and she
looking over lace samples, of which they have a great number. Madam in
"swell" street costume.)

_Mrs. De S._ (tossing samples in a heap). There's positively nothing
like it! Nothing anywhere near it!

_Madam_ No, and nothing that can be used.

_Mrs. De S._ (snatching a bit of lace from the heap). There! That's a
lover's knot pattern. Why, it--

_Madam_ No, that's a sailor's knot. There is a great difference.

_Mrs. De S._ (vaguely). I don't see it.

_Madam_ (patiently). You see the loop in this bends down and in this, it
bends--goes up. Every difference in the world, my dear Mrs. De
Smythe.

_Mrs. De S._ (meekly, but convinced). Wouldn't it do? All bunched up?

_Madam_ But it is not to be bunched up!

_Mrs. De S._ (with a profound sigh). What can we do? And I threatened
with an attack!

_Madam_ I don't know! (rises, sits down, then groans). I am at my wit's
end. Let me think.

_Mrs. De S._ (with an inspiration). Take the lace off!

_Madam_ (crushingly). My dear Mrs. De Smythe, the gown is modelled for
lace.

_Mrs. De S._ (helplessly). Oh!

(Madam sits in brown study, tapping her forehead.)

_Madam_ Let me see; Wednesday morning. (looks at watch). Ten o'clock. It
might be done. Practically two days. (sits staring at wall). No, it
couldn't! We might use chiffon.

_Mrs. De S._ Maude hates chiffon.

_Madam_ (with professional coldness). Chiffon is a very artistic
trimming.

_Mrs. De S._ (wearily). It may be--it may be, but you know Maude.

(Enter Miss Hoppenhoer.)

_Miss H._ (looks around; sniffs at the untidiness). Jennie, you look
ready to faint!

_Mrs. De S._ Sit down. Don't stand there like--a--wooden Indian!

_Miss H._ They don't keel over every few minutes, anyhow! (sits with a
thud). You look ready to faint!

_Mrs. De S._ I feel ready to faint; the lace has given out.

_Miss H._ (picking up things). The lace--?

_Mrs. De S._ (with infinite patience). The lace, you know, for Maude's
dress.

_Miss H._ (blankly). Eh--what dress?

_Madam_ (in polite surprise). Why, Miss Hoppenhoer, what dress?

_Mrs. De S._ (shrilly). What dress,--oh, Matilda!

_Miss H._ (commencing to "straighten" room in earnest). Oh, is that all?
I thought the President had been assassinated!

_Mrs. De S._ Matilda! I must say you don't seem much interested. I
should think you would,--your own niece, too!

_Miss H._ (tragically). Look at this room,--look at this room! It is a
disgrace to a Christian community! Think of the breakfast we had--or
rather, that we didn't have! And yesterday! And now you down
sick--down sick! Does it take a month to graduate? (dusts an
upholstered chair vigorously). It's such (bang) such non-(bang)
nonsense!

_Mrs. De S._ Nonsense to graduate! Matilda Hoppenhoer! Do stop
thrashing about! Ugh, that dust! (coughs weakly). Katherine will do
that.

_Miss H._ (pounding sofa cushions). Katherine is busy; she has ten miles
of flutin' to flute!

_Mrs. De S._ (coughing). Well, stop, anyway! My nerves are bad today.

_Miss H._ You are worn out. We're all as cross as bears!

_Madam_ (emerging from a brown study). What shall I do? And only a yard
needed! I think chiffon--

_Miss H._ (straightening out a rug). Use ribbon.

_Madam_ (with dignity). They used ribbon last year.

_Miss H._ Fringe, then,--fringe is very dressy.

_Madam_ They used fringe two years ago.

_Miss H._ (snapping her up). Well, what's the idea? To use something
that hasn't never been used?

(Maude comes in, breathless.)

_Maude_ (sitting down hard). Goodness, I'm tired! Auntie, your grammar
is bad--very bad. What are you doing?

_Miss H._ (sarcastically). Getting you ready to graduate.

_Maude_ (peeling off her gloves). Well sir, I've just been racing
around! O, Valeria's going to have chiffon.

_Madam_ (dramatically). Chiffon!

_Maude_ (tossing her hat on the floor). Yes, and it's awfully pretty.

_Madam_ Chiffon! Is she? (Sits, from sheer weakness.)

_Maude_ (beginning to undo sundry packages). Yes, and--why, what's the
matter?

_Madam_ (gasping). Chiffon!

_Maude_ (a light dawning). Am I? Am I?

_Miss H._ (winding yarn into a ball). Am you what? Sit down, child, sit
down, you look like a statute!

_Maude_ Am I to have chiffon?

_Mrs. De S._ (firmly). You are.

_Maude_ We can't both have chiffon! I won't be a copy-tale! I won't!

_Mrs. De S._ (sitting erect and speaking with authority). Listen,
dearie. The lace has given out.

_Maude_ (stamping her foot). Get more!

_Mrs. De S._ We can't.

_Madam_ And the gown is so modelled that we can use nothing else.

_Maude_ I won't have chiffon! I won't--I won't--I won't.

_Mrs. De S._ (warningly). Do not let Madame Sateene see you in a
passion.

_Maude_ Madam would be in a passion herself! She knows how I feel! O
dear! (begins to sob). Everything is going wrong! I w-w-won't
graduate, so there now!

_Miss H._ (mounting a chair to straighten a picture). That's sensible!
You needn't. I never did.

_Mrs. De S._ Matilda, do not encourage the child! Of course she must
graduate. Everybody does.

_Miss H._ (sarcastically). If everybody stood on their heads, I suppose
we'd have to!

_Mrs. De S._ You cannot judge in such matters, Matilda. You are very
old-fashioned.

_Miss H._ (upsetting contents of work basket in lap). Maybe so, maybe
so, but I am alive, and that child'll be dead if--

_Mrs. De S._ (holds her head). Matilda, for heaven's sake, stop!

_Maude_ I'll telephone Valeria. May be she--

_Mrs. De S._ (with decision). Maude, sit down! You will do nothing of
the sort. Mrs. Reynolds is such a talker! The whole town would know it
in ten minutes. Besides, at the Tuesday Club she cut me--actually
cut me! I will not permit it.

_Maude_ I don't think that ought to count, now. I suppose I have to have
something to wear.

_Madam_ What do you say to a Paris muslin?

_Maude_ (listlessly). What is a Paris muslin?

_Madam_ A sort of fine organdie.

_Maude_ Swell?

_Mrs. De S._ Maudie! Would Madam Sateene propose anything else? She
doesn't want you to look like a fright. Now, I think,--(pauses,
listening). Why there is papa's voice!

_Maude_ Papa, bless his old bones! Papa, come in here, quick! Hurry up!

(Mr. De Smythe comes in hastily.)

_Mr. De S._ What is it--what is it? Is Mamma worse?

_Maude_ (in tragic attitude). I can't graduate!

_Mr. De S._ (with profound astonishment). Can't graduate? Can't
graduate? Didn't you pass?

_Maude_ (scornfully). Pass! That doesn't matter! My dress, my dress, my
dress!

_Mr. De S._ (immensely relieved). Oh, your dress! Isn't it fine enough?

_Madam_ Why, you see, Mr. De Smythe, the--

_Maude_ (sobbing and clinging to his neck). I got to have chiffon, ugly,
limp, old chiffon! It is so--so--d--drabbled!

_Mr. De S._ Well, never mind! Hus-s-h! You'll make Mamma worse. You
needn't graduate! Never mind.

_Maude_ Oh, oh!

_Mr. De S._ Never mind, little girl, you needn't graduate! Never mind!

_Maude_ Oh, I--I must. The presents are coming in.

_Miss H._ (shortly). Return 'em.

_Maude_ You wouldn't, if they were yours! You know you wouldn't! Oh,
you're all so mean!

_Madam_ (soothingly). Let's have Paris muslin. It'll be lovely.

_Mrs. De S._ It's too stiff.

_Miss H._ And sounds too furrin! Haven't we got any American muslin? I'd
rather wear gunny sack.

_Mr. De S._ Hurrah for Matilda! A female Patrick Henry!

_Mrs. De S._ Papa, don't speak so loud!

_Mr. De S._ (contritely). I beg your pardon, Mamma,--your poor head!

_Maude_ I want something pretty! Not--not just--just any old thing!

_Madam_ (with awful dignity). Paris muslin is beautiful.

_Maude_ The other girls have silk.

_Mr. De S._ Then you must have silk, too,--decidedly. Mustn't she,
Mamma?

_Mrs. De S._ (sighing). I do not know, Papa, I do not know. This is a
dreadful time,--a dreadful time. I fear I shall not live to see her
graduate! (sighs dismally). But you will all enjoy it. Matilda, will
you heat the salt bags?

(Miss Hoppenhoer bounces out.)

_Maude_ (flies to couch). O, you precious, precious Mamma! Don't you
dare get sick and die!

(Katherine opens the door.)

_Katherine_ Miss Reynolds and Mr. Hamilton.

_Maude_ Hello, Valeria, how you vas? Jack, did you get 'em?

_Jack_ (bows to ladies, shakes hands with Mr. De Smythe). Couldn't
_Maude_, nothing but red.

_Maude_ Red! I can't wear red! Madam Sateene, can I?

_Madam_ (after due deliberation). Yes, you can. You will need a touch
of color.

_Valeria_ Why don't you carry pink ones?

_Jack_ Pink roses are lovely. You carried pink ones at the Junior
Banquet, didn't you, Val?

_Valeria_ (thoughtfully). Did I? Yes, I did! Bridesmaid, I think they
were.

_Maude_ I hate pink roses!

_Mrs. De S._ Maudie, Maudie, do not be so vehement!

_Mr. De S._ Never mind about the roses. They are a side issue. The
question is, "Wherewithal shall you be clothed!" I must be off to earn
your daily cake. Let's decide.

_Maude_ (pensively). Jack, do you like Paris muslin?

_Jack_ Is it anything like Plaster of Paris?

_Maude_ Jack, behave! I am so worried! (signs of tears.)

_Valeria_ She's just tired, poor dear; don't tease her, Jack.

_Maude_ (with dignity). I am not tired. He can't tease me, thank you,
_Valeria_. I think, Madam, I will have Paris muslin. Silk is so common.

_Jack_ Why don't you have bobinet?

_Valeria_ Why, Jack, bobinet is--

_Jack_ I know what bobinet is; heavy and kind of corded,--dead swell.

_Maude_ That's pique!

_Mr. De S._ Well, children, defer that discussion until the Fourth of
July. Is there time for a whole new rig?

_Madam_ Y-e-s,--I think so.

_Mr. De S._ Cheer up, everybody! We'll have the prettiest frock in the
outfit, if it breaks the R.I.P. Railroad! We are the people! I must go
hunt those papers--things are stirred up so! Good-bye, Mamma, don't
worry! Madam Sateene will save us! (goes).

_Madam_ (rising with alacrity). I shall go look at Paris muslins.
Shall I bring you samples?

_Mrs. De S._ No, I am not able to decide. We trust to you absolutely,
_Madam_ Sateene, absolutely. (groans). I believe I am going to have an
attack! Oh, dear, my nerves! They actually twitch! I wish Matilda were
of some use in such matters. Because she never graduated, she thinks
_Maude_ shouldn't! Jack, do you see my smelling salts?

(Jack hunts for the salts. Girls talk apart. Madam makes memoranda.)

_Madam_ Miss Maude, how would you like ribbon, very narrow satin ribbon?

_Maude_ Kate Saunders had that in--let me see,--oh, in 1900.

_Valeria_ And that French Girl,--Giggre--wore it last year.

_Madam_ O dear! (grimly). Anybody ever use rope?

_Jack_ (grinning). Only men--for neck-ties mostly. I can't find it, Mrs.
De Smythe.

_Mrs. De S._ Then Matilda has put it in the medicine chest. She is so
neat! I can't help it--I don't want to have an attack! What shall I
do? But I am afraid I--I am going to have one!

_Maude_ (with signs of tears). O, Mamma, don't have an attack! What
shall I do? No roses, no dress, no nothing!

_Madam_ (resolutely). Well, you shall have a dress, about noon, to give
you (with a tragic sweep of hand) if it is my last effort! Mrs. De
Smythe, I'll drop in and report! (Goes hastily.)

_Valeria_ I must go. I stopped for a list of my committee.

_Maude_ (absently). Don't go. What committee?

_Valeria_ Committee on Decorations.

_Maude_ (vaguely). Committee on--?

_Valeria_ Decorations. Wake up!

_Maude_ (goes to desk). O yes! (rummages). This desk is disgraceful!
Here it is! (Reads crumpled paper.) "Be it resolved--" goodness,
that's about poor Ned Woodruff! Jack, who was on that committee?

_Jack_ (smoothing Valeria's gloves on his knee). Miss Secretary, I do
not keep the minutes.

_Maude_ Well, you were presiding! (rummaging). Here it is,--six,--is
that enough? Five, rather,--Hal Taylor won't serve.

_Valeria_ (taking the list). O yes, he will.

_Maude_ Said he wouldn't! Told Mabel Hopeland so last night.

_Valeria_ (calmly). Yes, he will.

_Maude_ Well, he said he wouldn't.

_Valeria_ (pocketing the list, unmoved). He will if I ask him.

_Maude_ (shutting desk with a bang). Oh!

(Enter Miss Hoppenhoer, with shawls, salt bags, etc.)

_Miss H._ Jennie, you'd better go to bed.

_Mrs. De S._ (sadly). I will. I hope I shall not have an attack.

_Miss H._ Attack! We'll all have an attack before Friday night! (She
busies herself about the couch. Valeria and Maude go out.)

_Miss H._ Now, can you walk, do you think? I'd better call Katherine,
hadn't I? Katherine! Be careful of that bag--it's hot--awful hot! Lean
on me--(they go out, but Miss Hoppenhoer runs back to pick up things).

_Jack_ Can't I help you! A fellow never knows what to do
when--when--anybody has an attack.

(Maude returns.)

_Jack_ Come on, Maude, I've got an old tandem out there. Let's take a
spin.

_Miss H._ (dropping a shawl and two bottles). Got a what?

_Jack_ Go get ready, Maude. A tandem.

(Maude goes.)

_Miss H._ (moveless with astonishment). You ride it?

_Jack_ (respectfully). Yes, ma'am.

_Miss H._ (aghast). Ride it?

_Jack_ (fascinated). Yessum. (earnestly). Yes, ma'am.

_Miss H._ Ride a tantrum! Well, such goings on! And all of it comes from
graduating! Thank Heaven, I never graduated!

(Commences to pick up things. Curtain.)




ACT II.


(Sitting-room of the De Smythe home. Bouquets with cards attached.
Maude's desk, open, in confusion. Her hat and gloves on a chair. Jack,
Miss Rantum and Maude, latter "practicing.")

_Miss R._ (decidedly). It is best to hold it in one hand.

_Jack_ (surprised beyond measure). Oh, are you going to read it?

_Maude_ (standing in the middle of the room). W-e-l-l, not exactly read
it, you know.

_Maude_ I really know it--almost.

_Jack_ Then don't hold the paper.

_Maude_ (apprehensively). Oh, but if I should forget!

_Jack_ (confidently). You won't!

_Maude_ I might! Oh, it's very easy for you to say orate, for you can!

_Jack_ (conscious of ability). Yes, but you could, too.

_Miss R._ What is the subject of your oration, Mr. Hamilton?

_Jack_ (modestly). "Universality in Statecraft."

_Maude_ And it's a dandy! You ought to hear him when he comes to, "For
of all the nations, builded of power and sealed with blood--" (in
tremendous tones).

_Jack_ Oh, now, Maude, I say, let up.

_Maude_ Well, honest, you are fine. No I should die if I forgot,--just
simply die.

_Miss R._ It is wiser for her to hold her manuscript, I think. This is
an essay, not an oration.

_Maude_ (sitting down and getting up, a la Delsarte). Of course, Jack,
don't you see? It is an essay, not an oration. Now, did I get up
right?

_Miss R._ Try it again.

_Maude_ (repeats the operation and advances very stiffly). Is that it?

_Jack_ (judicially). Too corky.

_Miss R._ Be leisurely. Leisure is elegance. And bend more. Try it
again,--so. (illustrates).

_Maude_ (doing likewise). I do hope I won't drop anything. How was that?

_Miss R._ (hesitating). A trifle--just a trifle--well, er-stiff. Of all
things, a lady must rise well.

_Jack_ Yes, not as if she were shot out of a cannon!

_Maude_ Jack, you keep still!

_Miss R._ Try it again--so. (illustrates). Bend from the waist.

(Maude does so amid solemn silence.)

_Jack_ (graciously). That was better.

_Miss R._ Now, go on.

_Maude_ (reading). "Life's Inner Meanings."

_Miss R._ Louder and more deliberately. "Life's Inner Meanings."

_Maude_ "Life's Inner Meanings."

_Miss R._ Go on, not too fast. Don't hold it so high and bend the body
forward from the waist.

_Maude_ (in high shrill tones). "As a traveler, among the mighty
mountains, fails to realize the height to which he has climbed--"
(Stops, winded.)

_Miss R._ Compose yourself, compose yourself! Your voice is--well,
unnatural.

_Jack_ Yes, it's squeaky.

_Maude_ (with heat). It isn't! You're awfully mean! I've got to be
heard!

_Miss R._ Try it again. Use a deeper tone. "As a traveler, among the
mighty mountains, fails to realize the height--" Now, go on.

_Maude_ (nervously). "As a traveler, among the mighty mountains, fails
to realize the height to which he has climbed, so we, in Life's dusty
pathway, cannot estimate the distance we have traveled." O, Miss
Rantum, that isn't right!

_Miss R._ No, not exactly, not precisely right. You see, you--

_Jack_ Why don't you use "journeyed" instead of "traveled"?

_Maude_ (ignoring him). Miss Rantum, what is the matter with it? I'm not
doing as well as I did last week!

_Miss R._ No, you really aren't, but--

_Jack_ I say, why don't you change--

_Maude_ (imploringly). What is the matter, Miss Rantum?

_Miss R._ It isn't firm. You don't seem to know what you are saying.

_Maude_ (in grave-yard tones). "As the traveler, among the mighty
mountains, fails to--"

_Jack_ (ditto). Finally, my beloved brethren--

_Miss R._ (hastily). Lighter, but firmly. Use a conversational tone, "As
the traveler, among the mountains;" "It is a very pleasant day," "How
do you do?" See?

_Maude_ (in light, quivering tones). "As a traveler, among the
mountains--mighty mountains--fails to realize the height to which he
has climbed--has climbed, so we, in Life's dusty pathway, cannot
estimate the distance we have traveled."

_Jack_ "Climbed--climbed." I don't like "climbed" there; wouldn't
"attained" be better?

_Maude_ Professor Grindem didn't say so.

_Jack_ "Attained" is a prettier word.

_Maude_ (earnestly). Do you think so?

_Miss R._ "Climbed" is better. It is a real traveler and real mountains,
hence "climbed." "Attained" sounds as if it were ideals, you know.

_Maude_ (sighing profoundly). Yes, I think so, too. Besides, it's too
late to change it now. I'd forget.

_Jack_ All right! "On with the dance." I'm no judge.

_Miss R._ Go on with the next paragraph.

_Maude_ The next isn't a paragraph.

_Miss R._ (very patiently and gently). Well, go on with the next.

_Maude_ "Among life's bright flowers, its rugged slopes, its pleasant
walleys--"

_Miss R._ Valleys.

_Maude_ "Its pleasant walleys, its--"

_Miss R._ Valleys.

_Maude_ (nervously). Let me start over.

_Miss R._ Well, only use deeper tones. (She sits down.)

_Maude_ (very slowly). "Among life's bright flowers, its rugged slopes,
its pleasant walleys--valleys, its dangerous pitfalls, we cannot
realize the magnitood of the common things about us."

_Miss R._ "Magnitude," not "tood."

_Maude_ "The magnitude of the common things about us."

_Miss R._ Touch "common things" more lightly; "of the common things
about us,"--"common things."

_Maude_ (takes a sprint). We cannot realize the magnitood--tude--of the
"common--" oh, dear, I can never say it!"

_Miss R._ Yes, you can. You are doing well,--remarkably well.

_Maude_ O Miss Rantum!

_Jack_ You are, honest Injun! It'll be dandy.

_Miss R._ Please read,--are you tired standing?

_Maude_ (dismally). No,--I got to get it.

_Miss R._ Please read that second paragraph--sentence--again.

_Maude_ (taking a brace). Among life's bright flowers, its rugged
slopes--

_Miss R._ R-r-r-rugged slopes.

_Maude_ Rugged slopes.

_Miss R._ No, r-r-rugged slopes. Trill your "r."

_Maude_ (flatly). I can't.

_Jack_ What's the use? I don't think she need. People only do that on
Decoration Day. "Br-rave, r-rugged heroes," you know.

(Enter Katherine.)

_Katherine_ Miss Maude, a letter from you--for you, I mean. (Hands one
in awestruck manner and escapes.)

_Jack_ That girl is scared to death at anything that looks like writing.
Did you see her?

_Miss R._ (leaning back in her chair). Is she of foreign extraction?

_Jack_ No, foreign distraction.

_Maude_ (falling into a chair and opening letter). From Valeria. She
can't come over this afternoon. She's got to, to--I can't make it out.
(spells slowly). B-a-an, B-a-n--

_Jack_ Banana, maybe. She's got to banana. Let me see it, I'm used to
her hand.

_Maude_ Indeed! (elaborately). Indeed, you are! Maybee this is your
note?

_Jack_ You needn't get so mad. Let her banana. I don't care!

_Maude_ (springing up). Neither do I! Take the note!

(Katherine appears at the door.)

_Katherine_ (in much trepidation). Perfesser Grindem.

_Jack_ (pleasantly). All right Katherine, we are perpared!

(Enter Professor Grindem.)

_Grindem_ (bows profoundly, repeatedly). Ah, good morning, ladies, good
morning! Mr. Hamilton, ah, good morning! How is the work progressing?

(Jack shakes hands. Miss Rantum bows distantly.)

_Maude_ (tearing note into tiny bits). I shall be scared to death.

_Grindem_ (cordially). Not at all, Miss Maude, ah, not at all! Not at
all! You will feel power,--power is ahem!--power is a great thing--a
great thing.

_Maude_ (dejectedly). Yes, Professor.

(Enter Mrs. De Smythe)

_Grindem_ May I hear the--ah, Mrs. De Smythe, good morning!

(Mrs. De Smythe adjusts herself on couch.)

_Mrs. De S._ Yes, Maudie, dear, read it all to us. O Matilda, Matilda,
my salts! Now, Maudie!

(Miss Hoppenhoer bustles in and takes her station behind couch.)

_Maude_ (painfully taking "position"). "Life's Inner Meanings."

_Mrs. De S._ A very pretty subject, I think.

_Miss H._ (sniffs). A very pretty broad one, I think!

_Maude_ (impressively). "Life's Inner Meanings."

_Miss R._ Stand straighter, Miss Maude--so.

_Jack_ I think that's awkward,--looks as if she were going to cry "Lay
on, Macduff!"

_Maude_ Why, Jack Hamilton!

_Mrs. De S._ Jack's only joking. Why don't you go on?

_Maude_ "Life's Inner Meanings," (then, very rapidly). "As a traveler
among the mighty mountains, fails to realize the height to which he
has climbed, so we, in Life's dusty pathway, cannot estimate the
distance we have traveled. Among life's bright flowers, its rugged
slopes, its pleasant walleys--valleys, its dangerous pitfalls, we
cannot realize the magnitood--tude--magnitude of the common things
about us." (Stops, breathless.)

_Miss R._ Don't sway so. Hold the body firm.

_Mrs. De S._ There's no hurry, child.

_Jack_ That pace would kill!

_Miss R._ (to Professor Grindem). Her voice is not deep enough. It lacks
impressiveness.

_Grindem_ Yes, it lacks power--power, I should say.

_Maude_ (near tears). I can't get a new voice for this old essay!

_Miss H._ Yes, you ought to; you ought to be made over if you're going
to graduate!

_Mrs. De S._ Do go on; I am very fond of the next part.

_Maude_ (continues). "We stand upon the brink--"

_Miss R._ More rapidly there, "We stand upon the brink!"

_Maude_ (in exact imitation). "We stand upon the brink."

_Jack_ (ditto). That is, if we don't fall off--

_Maude_ Make Jack be still or I--I--can't!

_Jack_ Beg your pardon, but really, 'a brink,' you know.

_Maude_ "We stand upon the brink--who can guess what say the dashing
waters beneath? Who can interpret the silence of the eternal stars? We
rest in the walley--valley, who can understand the whispering of the
leaves? Who can read the secrets of the ocean blue? O, deep are the
inner meanings,--deep, deep are the mysteries of nature, infinite are
the suggestions of life!"

_Grindem_ Too, rapidly, Miss Maude,--too rapidly. Those are grand
sentiments,--give 'em time--give 'em time.

_Miss R._ There is not enough emotion in the climax: "Deep, deep are the
mysteries of nature!" Read it (in a cellerage tone). "Deep, deep are
the mysteries of nature!"

_Maude_ (using the "vox humana stop"). "Deep, deep are the mysteries of
nature!"

_Mrs. De S._ (soothingly). You are not doing so well, Maudie, today.

_Miss H._ No, I think you get worse.

_Maude_ Nobody c-could! You all find fault. (weeps). You couldn't do any
better--none of you--so there now!

_Miss H._ Never mind! It doesn't matter. Don't graduate.

_Maude_ (still weeping). It does matter! It d-does! I don't want to
disgrace the family.

_Miss H._ Ought to have commenced sooner, then, if you didn't!

_Voice from without._ Who's going to disgrace the family? I'd like to
see 'em try it.

(As Mr. De Smythe appears, Professor Grindem and Jack go out, in deep
converse.)

_Maude_ I am!

_Mr. De S._ Oh, no, you're not,--not by the R.I.P. Railroad!
(cheerfully). You won't be permitted to, Miss! Doesn't the dress fit?

_Maude_ (with intense scorn). The dress! Oh, Papa, my piece!

_Mr. De S._ O, you're piece! Say it to me! I haven't heard it today.

_Maude_ You're making fun of me!

_Miss H._ The child is worn out.

_Maude_ I am not worn out! I am not a baby! (collapses). I wish I was
d-d-dead!

_Mrs. De S._ O dear! O dear! Maudie, child!

_Maude_ I just w-wish I was.

_Mr. De S._ W-h-y-ee! When I have brought you your present! I am
astonished!

_Maude_ Have you? Oh, Papa, have you? Let me see!

_Mr. De S._ (taking out of his pocket a tiny case). No more tears?

_Maude_ (rubbing eyes hard). No--never.

_Mr. De S._ Honest? I've never seen so many tears. We are a Johnstown
flood lately. (Gives jeweler's case.)

_Maude_ A watch! A w-a-t-c-h!! (flies at him).

(Re-enter Jack and Mr. Bulbus.)

_Mr. Bulbus._ (bows awkwardly). I come to see about them decorations.

_Maude_ (rapturously). A watch!

_Mr. De S._ Guess we don't need 'em, Mr. Bulbus. There is something
going on at the school that night.

_Maude_ I was afraid it would be books. (She and Jack examine the watch
aside.)

_Mrs. De S._ We might have a reception.

_Miss H._ Jennie, you'll be sick! Mark my words, you'll have an attack!

_Mrs. De S._ But it's so nearly over--

_Mr. De S._ Ought we to have one? Does everybody?

_Miss H._ (sarcastically). Does everybody have what? Have an attack?

_Mr. De S._ (patiently). A reception.

_Mrs. De S._ It's the thing to do, isn't it, Miss Rantum?

_Miss R._ (looks up from Maude's MS., which she has been studying). I
beg your pardon, Mrs. De Smythe?

_Mrs. De S._ It's the thing to do--to have a reception, isn't it?

_Miss R._ They always do in Boston.

_Maude_ Do what in Boston?

_Miss R._ They have receptions. (with great dignity).

_Jack_ And Beans.

(Miss Rantum straightens up to retort, but Mr. De Smythe cuts in.)

_Mr. De S._ And here is Mr. Bulbus waiting! He is a business man, you
know. When do you want him, Jennie?

_Mr. B._ (confusedly). Yes, sir.

_Maude_ (sweetly). You'd just as soon wait, wouldn't you, Mr. Bulbus?

_Mr. B._ (blushing, drops hat). Yes, I-d--I'd--I'd rather.

_Mrs. De S._ We must decide while Mr. Bulbus is here, so we can get his
suggestions.

_Mr. B._ (standing like a stork). Yes'sum.

_Miss R._ (preparing to depart). Well, Miss Maude, I think we will not
need another rehearsal.

_Maude_ Oh, Miss Rantum, do you think I can do it all right?

_Miss R._ Yes, I think so. You must rest this evening.

_Maude_ The Juniors are to give us a spread.

_Miss R._ (definitely). But you must not go. Mr. De Smythe, may I speak
to you?

_Mr. De S._ Go on with your reception business. Mr. Bulbus hasn't all
day. (Goes out with Miss Rantum.)

_Mr. B._ (changes weight to other foot). Yes, sir.

_Mrs. De S._ Won't you be seated, Mr. Bulbus?

_Mr. B._ (sits on edge of small chair). Yessum, thank yer.

_Maude_ Let's have just the graduating class.

_Jack_ No, I'm dead tired of the push! Let's have a picked
crowd,--friends of "the highly contracting parties," you know.

_Mrs. De S._ We ought to have your professors.

_Maude_ We'd have to invite Grindem, and he's so awfully--

_Mrs. De S._ Professor Grindem is a very delightful gentleman, Maudie!

_Jack_ (in imitation). Yes, ahem, he has--power--ahem,--power is--power
is a wonderful thing, a wonderful thing!

_Mrs. De S._ Well, as to the decorations.

_Maude_ Smilax from the chandelier--

_Jack_ Don't let's have any smilax. It's too much like funerals.

(Mr. De Smythe returns.)

_Mr. De S._ Well, Mr. Bulbus, have they decided?

_Mrs. De S._ No, Papa, we can't decide who to have.

_Mrs. De S._ Let that slide now, and go into a committee of the whole on
decorations.

_Maude_ Let's--but I don't want the faculty.

_Jack_ You'd like to have Professor Graham. All girls are gone on him.

_Mrs. De S._ We needn't order cut flowers. All of Maudie's--(stops to
cough).

_Miss H._ (throws down her darning). Jennie, you'll have an attack! I
won't be no committee! I won't encourage this nonsense. Education is
all right; everybody needs a little,--enough to make an honest livin'.
But look at your mother, look at your father! They're plumb wore out
settin' up nights to get you graduated! In my day when girls got
through school they quit, they didn't go to Commencin' and carrin' on!
I won't be no committee of the whole nor no other kind. When you're
all dead nobody can blame me! (walks out, sniffing disdainfully).

_Mrs. De S._ (rising hastily). Oh, dear, now she'll go sweep every room
in the house! (goes out in haste).

_Maude_ (springs up). Mamma mustn't wear herself out. It would be all
right if Auntie had graduated. (goes in haste).

_Mr. De S._ (gazing helplessly after them all). Matilda's Declaration of
Independence! (seating himself resignedly). Draw up your chairs,
gentlemen. We'll have to 'wait til the clouds roll by'.

(Curtain falls on the three men looking at each other silently.)




ACT III.


(Hallway of the DeSmythe house. Flowers on extra tables, cards
attached. Door bell in vestibule rings constantly; flowers and
packages arriving. Maude's picture hat, gloves and fan on chair. Mr.
Bulbus on ladder, measuring the wall. Katherine enters and re-enters,
with flowers and gifts. Miss Hoppenhoer flits in and out. Everybody
nervous.)

_Katherine_ The bill's been a-ringin' all morning like that. (arranges
flowers).

_Mr. B._ I should think you'd be tired. Ain't yer?

_Katherine_ No, it's as exciting as a wedding.

_Mr. B._ You wimmen like weddin's. I never see a woman as didn't.

_Katherine_ (wonderingly). Are you going to decorate the hall?

_Mr. B._ (largely). Of course,--palms and ropes of smilax--

(Enter Jack, carrying his hat and gloves.)

_Jack_ (agreeably). Good morning, Katherine. I let myself in, you not
being a regiment. (Katherine goes). Good morning, Mr. Bulbus. You look
pretty festive in here. (examines bouquets, reading cards aloud and
commenting). "Compliments of Harold Taylor."--Umph, got them here in
time, I should say. "With love of Edith."--girls always put on "with
love of." "Wishing you a joyous day. Dick Dowell." That's nice of
Dick, considering the late unpleasantness. "Lucile," of course;
"Lucile" in white and gold! A girl couldn't graduate unless she had
three 'Luciles' and a 'Maurine!' Golden Gate roses! Whew, that means
dough! Professor Graham, I'll bet! He's got dough and cheek--

(Maude runs down the stairs.)

_Jack_ O, hello, Maude! (gives a long whistle). Aren't we fine? Swagger!

_Maude_ (imploringly). Jack, how do I look?

_Jack_ Turn around,--slowly. (Maude revolves very slowly.)

_Maude_ (anxiously). Well?

_Jack_ You look--you look--out of sight! By George, you do!

_Maude_ (caressing her dress skirt). You like the train?

(Mr. Bulbus gets down and goes out, unnoticed by Maude.)

_Jack_ It's splendid. You're a--a queen! I'd kiss you--

_Maude_ (startled). H-u-s-h! Mr. Bulbus!

_Jack_ (coolly). Oh, he's gone.

_Maude_ Goodness, what if he'd been there!

_Jack_ (comfortably). He wasn't.

_Maude_ (trying to see the back of her train in glass). But you didn't
know it!

_Jack_ Don't you think I didn't know it! 'Spose I want to make the
poor duffer green with envy? I can't kiss you anyway, you're too fine.

_Maude_ No, I can't even sit down! Jack, you look awfully handsome.

_Jack_ Thank you. Would you wear a rose?

_Maude_ Of course--one of Dick's. Nice of Dick, wasn't it? (gets one;
puts it on; an operation requiring time and patience).

_Jack_ Don't leave so much green show. I want a contrast, not a study in
tints.

_Maude_ Don't touch me! Hold your arms out straight.

_Jack_ (standing like a sign post). Then hurry up! I am not the stuff
martyrs are made of.

_Maude_ Is that all right?

_Jack_ Stand off and get the effect. How can I tell?

_Maude_ (standing back). Put down your arms!

_Jack_ (obediently). Well?

_Maude_ (with enthusiasm). Perfectly lovely! My, I shall be proud of
you! For pity's sake, don't look at me!

_Jack_ Can't help it.

_Maude_ I don't mean now--goosey! I mean when I read. If I should
forget!

_Jack_ You won't! Keep your eye on Old South Church and--

_Maude_ On what?

_Jack_ I beg your pardon. On Miss Rantum.

_Maude_ Oh! It must be time,--where is everybody?

_Jack_ I'm here, (sits on arm of chair and gazes at her.)

_Maude_ O you, yes! But I mean mamma! I am so nervous!

_Jack_ You girls just try to be nervous. You think it's becoming.

(Enter Mrs. De Smythe, in black silk.)

_Mrs. De S._ The carriages have come. Where can Papa be?

_Maude_ (in dismay). O, it isn't time, is it? O horrors, where is my
essay? Jack, please look in my desk.

(Jack dashes out.)

_Maude_ Mamma, is my hair all right?

_Mrs. De S._ Yes, Maudie, yes, (dismally) you look lovely.

(Jack dashes in, essay in hand.)

_Jack_ Here it is, but don't practice now.

_Maude_ (pacing the floor). "As a traveler, among the mighty mountains,
fails to realize--to realize the heights to which he has climbed, so
we, in Life's dusty pathway, cannot estimate the distance we have--we
have,--cannot estimate the distance we have--" There, I knew I didn't
know it! What shall I do?

_Jack_ (brilliantly). Open your manuscript.

(Katherine enters, with letters and small package.)

_Maude_ (unseeing, resumes). "Deep, deep are the mysteries of nature,
infinite are--are--"

_Mrs. De S._ Maudie, here is a letter from Uncle John. (withholds
package).

_Maude_ (drops essay). O, I wonder what he sent! Is this all!

_Mrs. De S._ Why, Maudie! Read it.

_Maude_ (tears it open; reads). "My dearest Niece: Hail to the happy
day! 'Way down here in South Africa, 'mong monkeys and Boers, I feel
the excitement. We don't graduate down here, but we know people who
do. Never, I know, has the house of De Smythe been so shaken. In honor
thereof, I am sending a--a--" O, goodness, I can't--"a diamond
ring,"--a diamond! Hasn't it come?

_Mrs. De S._ Does he say when?

_Maude_ (referring to the letter). He says "I am sending--" Katherine
is such a stupy! (calls). Katherine--

_Mrs. De S._ Maybe this is it. (gives package).

(Katherine comes with pink roses.)

_Maude_ O, O. O.! Isn't it a beauty! Jack, look!

_Jack_ (just glancing). Umph! Yes, I see.

_Maude_ Dear Uncle John! Everybody is so good! It's bigger than
_Valeria_'s. Must I wear gloves? I don't care, I just won't.

_Mrs. De S._ Your roses, Maudie.

_Maude_ O, your roses, Jack! They're lovely!

_Jack_ (slowly). The red weren't pretty, so I got pink. I hope you'll--

_Maude_ (rapturously). I just love pink roses!

(Katherine comes in with a big package.)

_Maude_ (tearing away pink ribbons and tissue papers). "With Valeria's
dearest love." A bonbon dish! Isn't it lovely! And violets on it!

_Jack_ (with a grimace). It will hold two pounds!

_Maude_ It isn't a bit too big! If you won't fill it--well, there are
others. I'm forgetting my piece. "Deep, deep are the mysteries--"

_Jack_ Are you going to say it?

_Maude_ No, but I must really know it, you know, so I can look up often.

_Jack_ "O, I see clearly," said the blind man.

_Mrs. De S._ Dear, dear, this is just as if you were getting married!
(sinks into a chair; she has been examining the flowers). The presents
and the flowers and the carriages and--and everything. O, suppose you
were--suppose you were!

_Maude_ (with intense indignation). But I'm not! I'm graduating!

_Jack_ (disconsolately). I don't think they're much alike!

_Mrs. De S. But where is Papa?

_Jack_ As I came, I saw him at the drug store.

_Mrs. De S._ The drug store! Why in the world--oh, I remember now,--I
sent him. We'll never get off.

(Miss Hoppenhoer's voice is heard from somewhere, "O Jennie!")

_Mrs. De S._ (rising and collecting things dropped). I wonder what's
happened now? I hope Papa isn't killed! (hurries out).

_Maude_ (gazing at her ring). Aren't my presents pretty?

_Jack_ Yes, but you are prettier.

_Maude_ (archly). Thank you, Mr. Hamilton, but aren't you a little rash?
(holds roses to her face by way of contrast.)

_Jack_ (critically). No, I think not, on mature consideration. Your hair
looks like gold--California gold, and those lovely lilies! Who gave
you those lilies-of-the-valley? (suddenly).

_Maude_ (evasively). Why California gold?

_Jack_ O, it's redder, and then, it is a native product. You'd be mad if
I said antique gold.

_Maude_ But do you like antique gold better?

_Jack_ That isn't the point. Who gave you those lilies?

_Maude_ Aren't they dear?

_Jack_ (cruelly). Don't know,--didn't buy 'em. Whose tribute are they?

_Maude_ "Tribute" sounds like a funeral.

_Jack_ (with awful meaning). There may be a funeral. Whose are they?

_Maude_ (demurely). Mine.

_Jack_ (with infinite patience). You know what I mean, (with terrible
calmness). Who gave you those?

_Maude_ (preparing to cry). You're awfully cross, I think.

(Mr. Bulbus enters in rear hunting something. Maude sees him.)

_Jack_ (unmoved). Who gave you those?

_Maude_ (graciously, sweetly). Mr. Bulbus, the lilies are lovely.

_Mr. B._ (surprised into dropping a hammer). Yes'sum, I'm glad you--you
like 'em. (retreats in confusion.)

_Jack_ Oh! (slowly). That's awfully nice of you.

(Enter Mrs. De Smythe and Miss Hoppenhoer, bonnets and gloves on.)

_Mrs. De S._ Where is your father? It's time to go.

_Jack_ Past time. Grindem said to be there at 9:30.

_Mrs. De S._ What shall we do? I knew he would be late! I hope I shall
not have an attack!

_Miss H._ (grimly). No, I hope not--in that dress!

_Mrs. De S._ As if one's dress made any difference with an attack! O,
there he is! Well, Papa, you--good morning, Madam.

(Mr. De Smythe and Madam Sateene come in together.)

_Mr. De S._ My, how fine we look!

_Maude_ Madam Sateene, this shoulder--wrinkles.

_Madam_ Let me see. (Madam and Maude consult apart.)

_Mrs. De S._ We ought to go.

_Mr. De S._ Miss Rantum hasn't come.

_Jack_ (looking up from his own Ms.) O, I forgot! Miss Baked Beans will
meet us there. She couldn't come here.

_Maude_ She promised she would!

_Mr. De S._ All ready. How many of these do we take? (indicating
flowers). Need a dray?

_Maude_ Only Jack's--and I carry them. Jack, you carry my essay and
fan. (puts on hat). Is it straight? Where are my roses?

(Miss Hoppenhoer gives Mr. De Smythe two shawls and he goes.)

_Madam_ (anxiously). Wait one moment. (adjusts Maude's train). Now.

_Miss H._ Have you any lemon drops?

_Maude_ Of course not,--nobody carries lemon drops! Where is my
handkerchief!

_Jack_ (sheepishly, taking it out of his vest). Here it is.

_Mr. De S._ (from door). Come on, you people.

_Mrs. De S._ O dear, dear, I shall never stand it.

_Miss H._ (collecting salts and fans). We're coming.

_Mrs. De S._ O dear,--kiss me, Maudie. (sits down exhausted). It's just
like a wedding! I can't stand it! Some day you'll be getting married!

(Mr. Bulbus enters in the rear and just stands.)

_Jack_ (cheerfully). I hope so.

_Maude_ (arranging train to carry it gracefully). Poor Mamma!

_Mr. De S._ (from outside). Come on! Matilda, bring Mamma!

_Mrs. De S._ O, O, O!

_Maude_ Brace up, Mamma, you must.

_Mrs. De S._ (to her handkerchief). And only yesterday she was a baby!

_Miss H._ (snappishly.) And only day before yesterday you were!

_Mrs. De S._ (from outside). Come on--we must go.

_Chorus_ We're coming! (All start, collecting fans, handkerchiefs, and
gathering up trains, adjusting bonnets anew, etc.)

_Maude_ (as they rush for the door). O, look out for my flowers!
Jack, got my piece? I know I shall forget! What if we're late?
Good-bye, Mr. Bulbus! (all go).

(Curtain drops on Mr. Bulbus, gazing after Maude in a sort of trance.)




EPILOGUE.


(A Wednesday morning in May, 1905. Mr. and Mrs. Jack Hamilton at
breakfast. He reading a paper, totally absorbed. She opening her
letters; there are two by her plate.)

_Maude_ (reading letter and talking to herself). Well, Well! (reading).
I am not angry--not in the least. You dear old girl! (drops letter and
meditates). You dear old girl! (resumes reading). I know better,--you
wouldn't! (reads about a page without comment, then) W-h-y! Why! O
goodness gracious! Jack!

(Jack looks over top of paper absently, then resumes reading.)

_Maude_ (explosively). Jack, what do you think? Only fancy--Valeria
is--Jack, listen! Put down your horrid paper! Valeria is married.

(He looks at her vacantly.)

_Jack_ Well?

_Maude_ Well? Listen: Valeria is married.

_Jack_ (waking to the situation). Is that so! Valeria--well, well. I'm
not astonished.

_Maude_ (pensively). Why not?

_Jack_ (at a venture). O, because--she is so--so handsome.

_Maude_ (scornfully). She isn't handsome! Where are your eyes? She's
clever--clever, that's what Valeria is. But not handsome,--certainly
not. She squints.

_Jack_ (staring). I thought you were so fond of her.

_Maude_ (with dignity). I am, I am awfully fond of her--I've always
been. But (cuttingly) affection doesn't blind me. I can love her and
see her faults. Nobody ever called Valeria handsome.

_Jack_ (hunting his place on the page). Maybe it was stunning.

_Maude_ (with intense emphasis). Stunning!

_Jack_ (turning the page with a prodigious rattling). Hal used to rave
over her.

_Maude_ O! Hal, he--don't rattle your paper so, you make me nervous! Hal
didn't care for her.

_Jack_ (absently). No, I suppose not, I suppose not. Of course, nobody
could.

(Silence. Both read.)

_Maude_ (intent on letter and all to herself). I wonder what she wore!
She is too old for white. (reads aloud). "You'll be surprised, my
dear." Yes, I confess I am. (gazing at coffee urn thoughtfully). Yes,
I am. (resumes reading). Where was I? "I want to tell you first,
dear." Here it is. So she did wear white--now, I am astonished. (reads
on). For pity sakes! Jack

_Jack_ (starts violently, crushing paper). A man might as well live on
Vesuvius.

_Maude_ (in great excitement). But, Jack, guess who married her.

_Jack_ (with calm certainty). The man in the Moon. He's too jolly to
mind squints.

_Maude_ Just guess. You never can.

_Jack_ (impatiently, much wrought upon.) Then tell me.

_Maude_ (in an explosive). Hal!

_Jack_ (inanely). Hal!

_Maude_ (calmly, the mine sprung). Hal Taylor.

_Jack_ Hal Taylor. Well, I am--bobbed!

_Maude_ I'm not surprised.

_Jack_ You said Hal didn't care for her.

_Maude_ (very slowly). He doesn't, Jack. Hal was--roped in.

_Jack_ (stares, then gives vent to a long whistle of astonishment).
Well, you women!

_Maude_ Don't talk to me. I am disgusted!

_Jack_ (ruefully). Well! (He stares, folds napkin, unfolds it and takes
up his newspaper.)

_Maude_ Don't sit there, just saying "Well" all the time!

_Jack_ (slowly). Say, what is it to you?

_Maude_ (sobs a little). She h-has deceived me--basely deceived me. But
I don't care. I shall send her a cut-glass berry dish,--maybe a
Tiffany c-c-cut! (dries her eyes resolutely). Coffee, dear?

_Jack_ (irritably; a trifle suspicious yet). Yes, don't I always take
coffee?

_Maude_ (plaintively). Don't scold me. I cannot endure much more. To
think Valeria--

_Jack_ (with decision, carving the steak). Don't think, then. Drop it.
What's your other letter?

_Maude_ (sadly). I don't care--I don't care for anything. (takes a
biscuit). The biscuits are burned.

_Jack_ No, they are not. Never mind--give the letter to me.

(Maude gazes pensively at nothing. Jack opens the letter with a fork,
and reads silently.)

_Jack_ (to himself, muttering). Of course, it's money,--always money.
Only a dollar and fifty cents apiece,--a man ought not growl. Umph!
"The happy old days." Yes, I remember.

_Maude_ (meekly). Remember what, Jack, dear? (He reads. Silence. She
folds and unfolds Valeria's letter.)

_Jack_ (suddenly). By George!

_Maude_ (buttering a biscuit, slowly). What is it?

_Jack_ By George!

_Maude_ What is it? A woman might as well live on--on Vesuvius!

_Jack_ George Graham is in the New York legislature!

_Maude_ Professor George De Witt Graham!

_Jack_ (reading while he speaks). The same, my dear. We're to banquet
him; it seems he's made a big speech.

_Maude_ He was very handsome, and nice to us girls. He pulled us all
through chemistry.

_Jack_ (absently). Yes, he was a good wire puller. And now he's Senator,
Senator in New York. That's great.

_Maude_ How do you know? Is that from him?

_Jack_ This is the Alumni Letter.

_Maude_ Alumni?

_Jack_ (slowly and elaborately). Yes, my dear, the Alumni
Letter,--Alumni. We graduated in 1902,--possibly you remember the
circumstances. You ought to.

_Maude_ How long ago it seems,--how long, long ago!

_Jack_ Thank you. It is. Three years.

(Silence. He stirs coffee.)

_Maude_ The lace for my dress gave out,--do you remember? And I wore
Paris muslin and Mamma was sick.

_Jack_ It was a great day! You remember your Aunt?

_Maude_ Poor Aunty! I can see her now--so 'fraid I would forget--sitting
on the edge of her chair! And those lemon drops,--I thought I should
faint when Bob brought 'em up!

_Jack_ Yes, I remember how his shoes squeaked! And Bob would usher!

_Maude_ Poor Aunty, I hope she is happier now out among the Hottentots.
Aren't they Hottentots?

_Jack_ (with scholarly precision). Your Aunt, my dear, is in Korea.
Korea is an island just east of--

_Maude_ (vaguely). Well aren't the Hottentots there, too? I thought
they were all together over there somewhere,--all fat and dusty
together, with their queer hats like plates,--all praying and
embroidering lovely silks.

_Jack_ As I was saying, Korea is east of--of Asia.

_Maude_ (taking another biscuit). Asia was always hard for me. The
rivers had such dreadful names! "1902! 1902! We are the people, who
are you?" What fun we had! Let's go back!

_Jack_ Haven't time. You write 'em greetings and so on, and enclose
three dollars. I wonder where old Grindem is?

_Maude_ Old Grindem! You remember his side whiskers? I couldn't bear
that man! He was horrid on Commencement day--wouldn't wait one second!
Not one second! And Valeria, (she sighs heavily). Poor Valeria!

_Jack_ (cheerfully). You looked mighty pretty that day. You didn't need
any lace.

(She sighs gently and shakes her head.)

_Jack_ (with desperate cheerfulness). And your hair was like gold,--and
those lilies-of-the-valley! I remember I went so far as to think of
Solomon. How is it? "Solomon in all his glory--all his glory
was--was--Solomon was"--how is it?

_Maude_ "Was not arrayed like one of these."

_Jack_ O yes--"like one of these," of course. "Solomon in all his glory
was not arrayed like one of these." You were a sort of female Solomon.
Not a Mrs. Solomon,--perish the thought!

_Maude_ (reproachfully). Jack!

_Jack_ (still cheerfully). Who gave you those lilies? Come on--tell me
now. This is a sort of anniversary when "all things shall be made
clear." Old Bulbus?

(She braces herself with visible effort.)

_Jack_ It was awfully hard on me, your just carrying my roses and
putting old Bulbus' lilies in your Solomon hair.

_Maude_ They weren't B-B-Bulbuses.

_Jack_ Honest?

_Maude_ H-honest.

_Jack_ (gravely). Whose were they?

(Silence. Maude twists her napkin.)

_Jack_ (more gravely). Whose were they, Mrs. Hamilton?

_Maude_ You won't be mad?

_Jack_ Do I get "mad"? I am not a two-year-old!

_Maude_ Nor cross?

_Jack_ Whose lilies were those, I ask!

_Maude_ (sitting very erect). I am going to tell you!

_Jack_ (a trifle viciously). See that you do.

_Maude_ Hal sent those lilies.

_Jack_ (incredulous). Hal Taylor?

_Maude_ (with a dead period). Hal Taylor.

(He gazes at her sternly; she hides her face behind the coffee urn.)

_Jack_ Therefore, Valeria squints!

_Maude_ O don't, Jack!

_Jack_ (severely). The vanity of woman!

_Maude_ (rising quickly and coming round to his chair). But I have your
roses, Jack, in the box with my dress! And I shall send Valeria a
cut-glass berry-bowl--maybe a Tiffany cut!

(He pulls her down to him as curtain falls.)

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at

Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm

Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the

     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
